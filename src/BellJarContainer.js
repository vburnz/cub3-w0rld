        <p>The Bell Jar, Sylvia Plath's ultimate novel, publsihed under pseudonymn Virginia Lucas less than a year before her well-known suicide, explores themes of gender and power, refelctive of the gendered world of the 1950s (when the book was set) and the 1960s (when the book was written). </p>
        <p>Many female characters in Plath's novel experience moments of genedered violence, enacted upon them by a variety of actors, from boyfriend's, bosses, doctors, the system of academia itself, and even by other women</p>
        <blockquote>“Yes, my consuming desire is to mingle with road crews, sailors and soldiers, barroom regulars—to be a part of a scene, anonymous, listening, recording—all this is spoiled by the fact that I am a girl, a female always supposedly in danger of assault and battery. My consuming interest in men and their lives is often misconstrued as a desire to seduce them, or as an invitation to intimacy. Yes, God, I want to talk to everybody as deeply as I can. I want to be able to sleep in an open field, to travel west, to walk freely at night...”</blockquote>
