Torture 












i. The body of the condemned 


On i March 1757 Damiens the regicide was condemned ‘to make 
the amende honorable before the main door of the Church of Paris’, 
where he was to be ‘taken and conveyed in a cart, wearing nothing 
but a shirt, holding a torch of burning wax weighing two pounds'; 
then, ‘in the said cart, to the Place de Greve, where, on a scaffold 
that will be erected there, the flesh will be tern from his breasts, 
arms, thighs and calves with red-hot pincers, his right hand, holding 
the knife with which he committed the said parricide, burnt with 
sulphur, and, on those places where the flesh will be tom away, 
poured molten lead, boiling oil, burning resin, wax and sulphur 
melted together and then his body drawn and quartered by four 
horses and his limbs and body consumed by fire, reduced to ashes 
and his ashes thrown to the winds’ (Pieces originates .. ., 372-4). 

‘Finally, he was quartered,’ recounts the Gazette d’Amsterdam of 
1 April 1757. ‘This last operation was very long, because the horses 
used were not accustomed to drawing; consequendy, instead of 
four, six were needed; and when that did not suffice, they were 
forced, in order to cut off the wretch’s thighs, to sever the sinews 
and hack at the joints... 

‘It is said that, though he was always a great swearer, no blas¬ 
phemy escaped his lips; but the excessive pain made him utter 
horrible cries, and he often repeated: “My God, have pity on me! 
Jesus, help me!’’ The spectators were all edified by the solicitude 
of the parish priest of St Paul’s who despite his great age did not 
spare himself in offering consolation to the pa.ient.’ 

Bouton, an officer of the watch, left us his account: ‘The sulphur 
was lit, but the flame was so poor that only the top skin of the hand 
was burnt, and that only slightly. Then the executioner, his sleeves 
rolled up, took the steel pincers, which had been especially made

for the occasion, and which were about a foot and a half long, and 
pulled first at the calf of the right leg, then at the thigh, and from 
there at the two fleshy parts of the right arm; then at the breasts. 
Though a strong, sturdy fellow, this executioner found it so difficult 
to tear away the pieces of flesh that he set about the same spot two or 
three times, twisting the pincers as he did so, and what he took away 
formed at each part a wound about the size of a six-pound crown 
piece. 

'After these tearings with the pincers, Damiens, who cried out 
profusely, though without swearing, raised his head and looked at 
himself; the same executioner dipped an iron spoon in the pot con¬ 
taining the boiling potion, which he poured liberally over each 
wound. Then the ropes that were to be harnessed to the horses were 
attached with cords to the patient’s body; the horses were then 
harnessed and placed alongside the arms and legs, one at each 
limb. 

'Monsieur Le Breton, the clerk of the court, went up to the 
patient several times and asked him if he had anything to say. He 
said he had not; at each torment, he cried out, as the damned in hell 
are supposed to cry out, “Pardon, my God! Pardon, Lord.” 
Despite all this pain, he raised his head from time to time and looked 
at himself boldly. The cords had been tied so tightly by the men 
who pulled the ends that they caused him indescribable pain. 
Monsieur le Breton went up to him again and asked him if he had 
anything to say; he said no. Several confessors went up to him and 
spoke to him at length; he willingly kissed the crucifix that was held 
out to him; he opened his lips and repeated: “Pardon, Lord." 

‘The horses tugged hard, each pulling straight on a limb, each 
horse held by an executioner. After a quarter of an hour, the same 
ceremony was repeated and finally, after several attempts, the 
direction of the horses had to be changed, thus: those at the arms 
were made to pull towards the head, those at the thighs towards the 
arms, which broke the arms at the joints. This was repeated several 
times without success. He raised his head and looked at himself. 
Two more horses had to be added to those harnessed to the thighs, 
which made six horses in all. Without success. 

‘Finally, the executioner, Samson, said to Monsieur Le Breton 
that there was no way or hope of succeeding, and told him to ask 


their Lordships if they wished him to have the prisoner cut into 
pieces. Monsieur Le Breton, who had come down from the town, 
ordered that renewed efforts be made, and this was done; but the 
horses gave up and one of those harnessed to the thighs fell to the 
ground. The confessors returned and spoke to him again. He said 
to them (I heard him): “Kiss me, gentlemen." The parish priest of 
St Paul’s did not dare to, so Monsieur dc Marsilly slipped under the 
rope holding the left arm and kissed him on the forehead. The 
executioners gathered round and Damiens told them not to swear, 
to carry out their task and that he did not think ill of them; he 
begged them to pray to God for him, and asked the parish priest 
of St Paul’s to pray for him at the first mass. 

'After two or three attempts, the executioner Samson and he who 
had used the pincers each drew out a knife from his pocket and cut 
the body at the thighs instead of severing the legs at the joints; the 
four horses gave a tug and carried off the two thighs after them, 
namely, that of the right side first, the other following; then the 
same was done to the arms, the shoulders, the arm-pits and the four 
limbs; the flesh had to be cut almost to the bone, the horses pulling 
hard carried off the right arm first and the other afterwards. 

‘When the four limbs had been pulled away, the confessors came 
to speak to him; but his executioner told them that he was dead, 
though the truth was that I saw the man move, his lower jaw moving 
from side to side as if he were talking. One of the executioners even 
said shortly afterwards that when they had lifted the trunk to throw 
it on the stake, he was still alive. The four limbs were untied from 
the ropes and thrown on the stake set up in tie enclosure in line 
with the scaffold, then the trunk and the rest were covered with logs 
and faggots, and fire was put to the straw mixed with this wood. 

‘... In accordance with the decree, the whole was reduced to 
ashes. The last piece to be found in the embers was still burning at 
half-past ten in the evening. The pieces of flesh and the trunk had 
taken about four hours to bum. The officers of whom I was one, 
as also was my son, and a detachment of archers remained in the 
square until nearly eleven o'clock. 

‘There were those who made something of the fact that a dog 
had lain the day before on the grass where the fire had been, had 
been chased away several times, and had alway* returned. But it is

nor difficult to understand thar an animal found this place warmer 
than elsewhere’ (quoted in Zevaes, 201-14). 

Eighty years later, Leon Faucher drew up his rules ‘for the House 
of young prisoners in Paris': 

‘Art. 17. The prisoners’ day will begin at six in the morning in 
winter and at five in summer. They will work for nine hours a day 
throughout the year. Two hours a day will be devoted to instruc¬ 
tion. Work and the day will end at nine o’clock in winter and at 
eight in summer. 

Art. 18. Rising. At the first drum-roll, the prisoners must rise and 
dress in silence, as the supervisor opens the cell doors. At the second 
drum-roll, they must be dressed and make their beds. At the third, 
they must line up and proceed to the chapel for morning prayer. 
There is a five-minute interval between each drum-roll. 

Art. 19. The prayers are conducted by the chaplain and followed 
by a moral or religious reading. This exercise must not last more 
than half an hour. 

Art. zo. PF'ork. At a quarter tu si* iu the auuiiiici, a qumlci to 
seven in winter, the prisoners go dow-n into the courtyard where 
they must wash their hands and faces, and receive their first ration 
of bread. Immediately afterwards, they form into work-teams and 
go off to w'ork, which must begin at six in summer and seven in 
winter. 

Art. 2i. Meal. At ten o’clock the prisoners leave their work and 
go to the refectory; they wash their hands in their courtyards and 
assemble in divisions. After the dinner, there is recreation until 
twenty minutes to eleven. 

Art. 22. School. At twenty minutes to eleven, at the drum-roll, 
the prisoners form into ranks, and proceed in divisions to the 
school. The class lasts two hours and consists alternately of reading, 
writing, drawing and arithmetic. 

Art. 23. At twenty minutes to one, the prisoners leave the 
school, in divisions, and return to their courtyards for recreation. 
At five minutes to one, at the drum-roll, they form into work- 
teams. 

Art. 24. At one o’clock they must be back in the workshops: they 
work until four o’clock. 


Art. 25. At four o’clock the prisoners leave their workshops and 
go into the courtyards where diey wash their hands and form into 
divisions for the refectory. 

Art. 26. Supper and the recreation that follows it last until five 
o’clock: the prisoners then return to the workshops. 

Art. 27. At seven o’clock in the summer, at eight in winter, 
work stops; bread is distributed for the last time in the workshops. 
For a quarter of an hour one of the prisoners or supervisors reads a 
passage from some instructive or uplifting work. This is followed 
by evening prayer. 

Art. 28. At half-past seven in summer, half-past eight in winter, 
the prisoners must be back in their cells after the washing of hands 
and the inspection of clothes in the courtyard; at the first drum-roll, 
they must undress, and at the second get into bed. The cell doors 
are closed and the supervisors go the rounds in the corridors, to 
ensure order and silence’ (Faucher, 274-82). 

We have, then, a public execution and a time-table. They do not 
punish tire same crimes or the same type of delinquent. But they 
each define a certain penal style. Less than a century separates them. 
It was a time when, in Europe and in the United States, the entire 
economy of punishment was redistributed. It was a time of great 
‘scandals’ for traditional justice, a time of innumerable projects for 
reform. It saw a new theory of law and crime, a new moral or politi¬ 
cal justification of the right to punish; old laws were abolished, old 
customs died out. ‘Modem’ codes were planned or drawn up: 
Russia, 1769; Prussia, 1780; Pennsylvania and Tuscany, 1786; 
Austria, 1788; France, 1791, Year IV, 1808 and 1810. It was a new 
age for penal justice. 

Among so many changes, I shall consider one: the disappearance 
of torture as a public spectacle. Today we are rather inclined to ig¬ 
nore it; perhaps, in its time, it gave rise to too much inflated rhetoric; 
perhaps it has been attributed too readily and too emphatically to a 
process of‘humanization’, thus dispensing with the need for further 
analysis. And, in any case, how important is such a change, when 
compared with the great institutional transformations, the formula¬ 
tion of explicit, general codes and unified rules of procedure; with 
the almost universal adoption of the jury system, the definition of

Torture 


The body of the condemned 


the essentially corrective character of the penalty and the tendency, 
which has become increasingly marked since the nineteenth century, 
to adapt punishment to the individual offender? Punishment of a 
less immediately physical kind, a certain discretion in the art of 
inflicting pain, a combination of more subtle, more subdued suffer¬ 
ings, deprived of their visible display, should not all this be treated 
as a special case, an incidental effect of deeper changes? And yet the 
fact remains that a few decades saw the disappearance of the tor¬ 
tured, dismembered, amputated body, symbolically branded on face 
or shoulder, exposed alive or dead to public view-. The body as the 
major target of penal repression disappeared. 

By the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth 
century, the gloomy festival of punishment was dying out, though 
here and there it flickered momentarily into life. In this transforma¬ 
tion, two processes were at work. They did nor have quite the same 
chronology or the same raison d’etre. TTie first was the disappearance 
of punishment as a spectacle. The ceremonial of punishment tended 
to decline; it survived only as a new legal or administrative practice. 
The a*lend* honoiulU w«. first abolished in France in 1791, then 
again in 1830 after a brief revival; the pillory was abolished in 
France in 1789 and in England in 1837. The use of prisoners in 
public works, cleaning city streets or repairing the highways, was 
practised in Austria, Switzerland and certain of the United States, 
such as Pennsylvania. These convicts, distinguished by their 
‘infamous dress' and shaven heads, ‘were brought before the public. 
The sport of the idle and the vicious, they often become incensed, 
and naturally took violent revenge upon the aggressors. To prevent 
them from returning injuries which might be inflicted on them, 
they were encumbered with iron collars and chains to which bomb¬ 
shells were attached, to be dragged along while they performed their 
degrading service, under the eyes of keepers armed with swords, 
blunderbusses and other weapons of destruction’ (Roberts Vaux, 
Notices, ar, quoted in Teeters, 1937, 24). This practice was abolished 
practically everywhere at the end of the eighteenth or the beginning 
of the nineteenth century. The public exhibition of prisoners was 
maintained in France in 1831, despite violent criticism - ‘a disgust¬ 
ing scene', said Real (cf. Bibliography); it was finally abolished in 
April 1848. While the chain-gang, which had dragged convicts 


across the whole of France, as far as Brest and Toulon, was replaced 
in 1837 by inconspicuous black-painted cell-carts. Punishment had 
gradually ceased to be a spectacle. And whatever theatrical elements 
it still retained were now downgraded, as if the functions of the 
penal ceremony w'ere gradually ceasing to be understood, as if this 
rite that ‘concluded the crime’ was suspected of being in some 
undesirable way linked with it. It was as if the punishment was 
thought to equal, if not to exceed, in savagery the crime itself, to 
accustom the spectators to a ferocity from which one wished to 
divert them, to show them the frequency of crime, to make the 
executioner resemble a criminal, judges murderers, to reverse roles 
at the last moment, to make the tortured criminal an object of pity 
or admiration. As early as 1764, Beccaria remarked: ‘The murder 
that is depicted as a horrible crime is repeated in cold blood, 
remorselessly’ (Beccaria, 101). The public execution is now seen as 
a hearth in which violence bursts again into flame. 

Punishment, then, will tend to become the most hidden part of 
the penal process. This has several consequences: it leaves the 
domain of more or less everyday perception and enters that of 
abstract consciousness; its effectiveness is seen as resulting from its 
inevitability, not from its visible intensity; it is the certainty of being 
punished and not the horrifying spectacle of public punishment that 
must discourage crime; the exemplary mechanics of punishment 
changes its mechanisms. As a result, justice no longer takes public 
responsibility for the violence that is bound tp with its practice. 
If it too strikes, if it too kills, it is not as a glorification of its strength, 
but as an element of itself that it is obliged to tolerate, that it finds 
difficult to account for. The apportioning of blame is redistributed: 
in punishment-as-spectaclc a confused horrer spread from the 
scaffold; it enveloped both executioner and condemned; and, al¬ 
though it was always ready to invert the shame inflicted on the 
victim into pity or glory, it often turned the legal violence of the 
executioner into shame. Now the scandal and the light are to be 
distributed differently; it is the conviction itself that marks the 
offender with the unequivocally negative sign: the publicity has 
shifted to the trial, and to the sentence; the execution itself is like an 
additional shame that justice is ashamed to impose on the con¬ 
demned man; so it keeps its distance from the act, tending always to 


9

entrust it to others, under the seal of secrecy. It is ugly to be punish¬ 
able, but there is no glory in punishing. Hence that double system 
of protection that justice has set up between itself and the punish¬ 
ment it imposes. Those who carry out the penalty tend to 
become an autonomous sector; justice is relieved of responsibility 
for it by a bureaucratic concealment of the penalty itself. It is 
typical that in France the administration of the prisons should for so 
long have been the responsibility of the Ministry of the Interior, 
while responsibility for the bagnes, for penal servitude in the convict 
ships and penal settlements, jay with the Ministry of the Navy or 
the Ministry of the Colonies. And beyond this distribution of roles 
operates a theoretical disavowal: do not imagine that the sentences 
that we judges pass are activated by a desire to punish; they are 
intended to correct, reclaim, ‘cure’; a technique of improvement 
represses, in the penalty, the strict expiation of evil-doing, and 
relieves the magistrates of the demeaning task of punishing. In 
modem justice and on the part of those who dispense it there is a 
shame in punishing, which does not always preclude zeal. This 
sense of shame is constantly growing: the psydiolugists and the 
minor civil servants of moral orthopaedics proliferate on the wound 
it leaves. 

The disappearance of public executions marks therefore the decline 
of the spectacle; but it also marks a slackening of the hold on the 
body. In 1787, in an address to the Society for Promoting Political 
Enquiries, Benjamin Rush remarked: ‘I can only hope that the time 
is not far away when gallows, pillory, scaffold, flogging and wheel 
will, in the history of punishment, be regarded as the marks of the 
barbarity of centuries and of countries and as proofs of the feeble 
influence of reason and religion over the human mind' (Teeters, 
* 935 * 3 °)- Indeed, sixty years later, Van Meenen, opening the second 
penitentiary congress, in Brussels, recalled the time of his childhood 
as of a past age: ‘1 have seen the ground strewn with wheels, 
gibbets, gallows, pillories; I have seen hideously stretched skeletons 
on wheels’ (Annales de la Charlie, 529-30). Branding had been 
abolished in England (1834) and in France (1832); in 1820, England 
no longer dared to apply the full punishment reserved for traitors 
(Thistlewood was not quartered). Only flogging still remained in a 
number of penal systems (Russia, England, Prussia). But, generally 


speaking, punitive practices had become more reticent. One no 
longer touched the body, or at least as little as possible, and then 
only to reach something other than the body itself. It might be 
objected that imprisonment, confinement, forced labour, penal 
servitude, prohibition from entering certain areas, deportation — 
which have occupied so important a place in modem penal systems - 
are ‘physical’ penalties: unlike fines, for example, they directly 
affect the body. But the punishment-body relation is not the same 
as it w'as in the torture during public executions. The body now 
serves as an instrument or intermediary: if one intervenes upon it 
to imprison it, or to make it work, it is in order to deprive the 
individual of a liberty that is regarded both as a right and as property. 
The body, according to this penality, is caught up in a system of 
constraints and privations, obligations and proh:bitions. Physical 
pain, the pain of the body itself, is no longer the ccnstituent element 
of the penalty. From being an art of unbearable sensations punish¬ 
ment has become an economy of suspended rights. If it is still 
necessary for the law to reach and manipulate the body of the con¬ 
vict, it will be at a distance, in the proper way, according to strict 
rules, and with a much ‘higher’ aim. As a result of this new restraint, 
a whole army of technicians took over from the executioner, the 
immediate anatomist of pain: warders, doctors, chaplains, psychia¬ 
trists, psychologists, educationalists; by their very presence near the 
prisoner, they sing the praises that the law needs: they reassure it 
that the body and pain are not the ultimate objects of its punitive 
action. Today a doctor must watch over those condemned to death, 
right up to the last moment - thus juxtaposing himself as the agent 
of welfare, as the alleviator of pain, with the official whose task it is 
to end life. This is worth thinking about. When the moment of 
execution approaches, the patients are injected with tranquillizers. 
A utopia of judicial reticence: take away life, but prevent the patient 
from feeling it; deprive the prisoner of all rights, but do not inflict 
pain; impose penalties free of all pain. Recourse to psycho-pharma¬ 
cology and to various physiological 'disconnectors’, even if it is 
temporary, is a logical consequence of this ‘non-corporal’ penality. 

The modern rituals of execution attest to this double process: the 
disappearance of the spectacle and the elimination of pain. The same 
movement has affected the various European legal systems, each at 


to 


11 










Torture 


The body of the condemned 


its own rate: the same death for all - the execution no longer bears 
the specific mark of the crime or the social status of the criminal; a 
death that lasts only a moment - no torture must be added to it in 
advance, no further actions performed upon the corpse; an execution 
that affects life rather than the body. There are no longer any of 
those long processes in which death was both retarded by calculated 
interruptions and multiplied by a series of successive attacks. There 
are no longer any of those combinations of tortures that were 
organized for the killing of regicides, or of the kind advocated, at 
the beginning of the eighteenth century, by the anonymous author 
of Hanging not Punishment Enough (1701), by which the condemned 
man would be broken on the wheel, then flogged until he fainted, 
then hung up with chains, then finally left to die slowly of hunger. 
There are no longer any of those executions in which the condemned 
man was dragged along on a hurdle (to prevent his head smashing 
against the cobble-stones), in which his belly was opened up, his 
entrails quickly ripped out, so that he had time to see them, with his 
own eyes, being thrown on the fire; in which he was finally decapi¬ 
tated and hie body quartered. 1 The reduction of these 'thousand 
deaths’ to strict capital punishment defines a whole new morality 
concerning the act of punishing. 

As early as 1760, a hanging machine had been tried out in 
England (for the execution of Lord Ferrer). It made use of a support, 
which opened under the feet of die condemned man, thus avoiding 
slow deaths and the altercations that occurred between victim and 
executioner. It was improved and finally adopted in 1783, the same 
year in which the traditional procession from Newgate to Tyburn 
was abolished, and in which the opportunity offered by the rebuild¬ 
ing of the prison, after the Gordon Riots, was used to set up the 
scaffolds in Newgate itself (see Hibberr, 85-6). The celebrated 
article 3 of the French Code of 1791 - ‘Every man condemned to 
death will have his head cut off’ - bears this triple signification: an 
equal death for all (‘Crimes of the same kind will be punished by the 
same kind of punishment, whatever the rank and state of the guilty 
man may be,’ in the words of the motion proposed by Guillotin and 
passed on 1 December 1789); one death per condemned man, 
obtained by a single blow, without recourse to those ‘long and 
consequently cruel’ methods of execution, such as the gallows, 


denounced by Le Peletier; lastly, punishment for the condemned 
man alone, since decapitation, the capital punishment of the nobility, 
was the least shaming for the criminal’s family (Le Peletier, 720). 
The guillotine, first used in March 1792, was the perfect vehicle for 
these principles. Death was reduced to a visible, but instantaneous 
event. Contact between the law, or those who carry it out, and the 
body of the criminal, is reduced to a split second. There is no 
physical confrontation; the executioner need be no more than a 
meticulous watchmaker. ‘Experience and reason demonstrate that 
die method used in the past to cut off the head of a criminal exposed 
him to a torture more frightful than the loss of life alone, which is 
the express intention of the law; the execution should therefore be 
carried out in a single moment and with a single blow; examples 
show how difficult it is to achieve this. For the method to work 
perfectly, it must necessarily depend on invariable mechanical 
means whose force and effect may also be determined. . . It is an 
easy enough matter to have such an unfailing machine built; decapi¬ 
tation will be performed in a moment according to the intention of 
the new law. If this apparatus seems necessary, it will cause no 
sensation and will be scarcely noticed’ (Saint-Edme, 161). The 
guillotine takes life almost without touching the body, just as prison 
deprives of liberty or a fine reduces wealth. It is intended to apply 
the law not so much to a real body capable of feeling pain as to a 
juridical subject, the possessor, among other rights, of the right to 
exist. It had to have the abstraction of the law itself. 

No doubt something of the old public execution was, for a time, 
superimposed in France on the sobriety of the new method. Parri¬ 
cides - and the regicides who were regarded as such - were led to 
tile scaffold wearing a black veil; there, until 1832, one of their 
hands was cut off. Thereafter, nothing remained but the ornamental 
crepe. Thus it was in the case of Fieschi, the wculd-be assassin of 
Louis-Philippe, in November 1836: ‘He will be taken to the place 
of execution wearing a shirt, barefoot, his head covered with a black 
veil; he will be exhibited upon a scaffold while an usher reads the 
sentence to the people, and he will be immediately executed.’ We 
should remember Damiens - and note that the last addition to penal 
death was a mourning veil. The condemned man was no longer to 
be seen. Only the reading of the sentence on the scaffold announced 


12

Torture 


The body of the condemned 


the crime - and that crime must be faceless. (The more monstrous a 
criminal was, the more he must be deprived of light: he must not see, 
or be seen. This was a common enough notion at the time. For the 
parricide one should ‘construct an iron cage or dig an impenetrable 
dungeon that would serve him as an eternal retreat’ - De Molene, 
2 75 ~ 7 -) The last vestige of the great public execution was its annul¬ 
ment: a drapery to hide a body. Benoit, triply infamous (his 
mother’s murderer, a homosexual, an assassin), was the first of the 
parricides not to have a hand cur off: ‘As the sentence was being 
read, he stood on the scaffold supported by the executioners. It was 
a horrible sight; wrapped in a large white shroud, his face covered 
with black crepe, the parricide escaped the gaze of die silent crowd, 
and beneath these mysterious and gloomy clothes, life was mani¬ 
fested only by frightful cries, which soon expired under the knife’ 
(Gazette ties iribunaux , 30 August 1832). 

At the beginning of die nineteenth century, then, the great 
spectacle of physical punishment disappeared; the tortured body 
was avoided; the theatrical representation of pain was excluded from 
punishment. The age of sobriety in punishment had begun. By 
r 830 48, public executions, preceded by torture, had almost entirely 
disappeared. Of course, this generalization requires some qualifica¬ 
tion. To begin with, the changes did not come about at once or as 
part of a single process. There were delays. Paradoxically, England 
was one of the countries most loath to see the disappearance of the 
public execution: perhaps because of the role of model that the 
institution of rhe jury, public hearings and respect of habeas corpus 
had given to her criminal law; above all, no doubr, because she did 
not wish to diminish the rigour of her penal laws during die great 
social disturbances of the years 1780-1820. For a long time Romilly, 
Mackintosh and Fowell Buxton failed in their attempts to artenuaie 
the multiplicity and severity of the penalties laid down by English 
law - that ‘horrible butchery’, as Rossi described it. Its severity (in 
fact, the juries regarded the penalties laid down as excessive and 
were consequently more lenient in their application) had even 
increased: in 1760, Blackstone had listed 160 capital crimes in 
English legislation, while by 1819 there were 223. One should also 
take into account the advances and retreats that the process as a 
whole undement between 1760 and 1840; the rapidity of reform 

M 


in certain countries such as Austria, Russia, Lie United States, 
France under rhe Constituent Assembly, then the retreat at the 
time of die counter-revolutions in Europe and the great social fear 
of the years 1820-48; more or less temporary charges introduced by 
emergency courts or laws; the gap between the laws and the real 
practice of the courts (which was by no means a faithful reflection 
of the state of legislation). All these factors account for the irregu¬ 
larity of the transformation that occurred at the turn of the century. 

It should be added that, although most of the changes had been 
achieved by 1840, although the mechanisms of punishment had by 
then assumed their new way of functioning, the process was far 
from complete. The reduction in the use of torture was a tendency 
that was rooted in the great transformation of the years 1760-1840, 
but it did not end there; it can be said that the practice of the public 
execution haunted our penal system for a long time and still haunts 
it today. In France, die guillotine, that machine for the production 
of rapid and discreet deaths, represented a new ethic of legal death. 
But die Revolution had immediately endowed it with a great theatri¬ 
cal ritual. Fui ycats it provided a spectacle. It had to be removed to 
the Barri£re Saint-Jacques; the open cart was replaced by a closed 
carriage; the condemned man was hustled from the vehicle straight 
to the scaffold; hasty executions were organized at unexpected times. 
In the end, the guillotine had to be placed insice prison walls and 
made inaccessible to the public (after the execution of Weidmann 
in 1939), by blocking the streets leading to the prison in which the 
scaffold was hidden, and in which the execution would take place in 
secret (the execution of Buffet and Bontemps at the Same in 1972). 
Witnesses who described the scene could even be prosecuted, there¬ 
by ensuring that the execution should cease to be a spectacle and 
remain a strange secret between the law and those it condemns. One 
has only to point out so many precautions to realize that capital 
punishment remains fundamentally, even today, a spectacle that 
must actually be forbidden. 

Similarly, the hold on the body did not entirely disappear in the 
mid-nineteenth century. Punishment had no doubt ceased to be 
centred on torture as a technique of pain; it assumed as its principal 
object loss of wealth or rights. But a punishment like forced labour 
or even imprisonment - mere loss of liberty - has never functioned 



15 







Torture 


without a certain additional element of punishment that certainly 
concerns the body itself: rationing of food, sexual deprivation, 
corporal punishment, solitary confinement. Are these the uninten¬ 
tional, but inevitable, consequence of imprisonment? In fact, in its 
most explicit practices, imprisonment has always involved a certain 
degree of physical pain. The criticism that was often levelled at the 
penitentiary system in the early nineteenth century (imprisonment 
is not a sufficient punishment: prisoners are less hungry, less cold, 
less deprived in general than many poor people or even workers) 
suggests a postulate that was never explicitly denied: it is just that a 
condemned man should suffer physically more than other men. It is 
difficult to dissociate punishment from additional physical pain. 
What would a non-corporal punishment be? 

There remains, therefore, a rrace of ‘torture’ in the modern 
mechanisms of criminal justice - a trace that has not been entirely 
overcome, but which is enveloped, increasingly, by the non-corporal 
nature of the penal system. 

The reduction in penal severity in the last zoo yeais is a pheno¬ 
menon with which legal historians are well acquainted. But, for a 
long time, it has been regarded in an overall way as a quantitative 
phenomenon: less cruelty, less pain, more kindness, more respect, 
more ‘humanity’. In fact, these changes are accompanied by a dis¬ 
placement in the very object of the punitive operation. Is there a 
diminution of intensity? Perhaps. There is certainly a change of 
objective. 

If the penality in its most severe forms no longer addresses itself 
to the body, on what does it lay hold? The answer of the theoreti¬ 
cians - those who, about 1760, opened up a new period that is not 
yet at an end - is simple, almost obvious. It seems to be contained 
in the question itself: since it is no longer the body, it must be the 
soul. The expiation that once rained down upon the body must be 
replaced by a punishment that acts in depth on the heart, the 
thoughts, the will, the inclinations. Mably formulated the principle 
once and for all: ‘Punishment, if I may so put it, should strike the 
soul rather than the body’ (Mably, 326). 

It was an important moment. The old partners of the spectacle 
of punishment, the body and the blood, gave way. A new character 


The body of the condemned 

came on the scene, masked. It was the end of a certain kind of 
tragedy; comedy began, with shadow play, faceless voices, impalp¬ 
able entities. The apparatus of punitive justice must now bite into 
this bodiless reality. 

Is this any more than a mere theoretical assertion, contradicted 
by penal practice? Such a conclusion would be over-hasty. It is true 
that, today, to punish is not simply a matter of converting a soul; 
but Mably’s principle has not remained a pious vish. Its effects can 
be felt throughout modern penality. 

To begin with, there is a substitudon of objects. By this I do not 
mean that one has suddenly set about punishing other crimes. No 
doubt the definition of offences, the hierarchy of their seriousness, 
the margins of indulgence, what was tolerated in fact and what was 
legally permitted - all this has considerably changed over the last 
200 years; many crimes have ceased to be so because they were 
bound up with a certain exercise of religious authority or a par¬ 
ticular type of economic activity; blasphemy has lost its status as a 
crime; smuggling and domestic larceny some of their seriousness. 
But these displacements are perhaps not the most important fact: 
the division between the permitted and the forbidden has preserved 
a certain constancy from one century to another. On the other 
hand, ‘crime’, the object with which penal practice is concerned, has 
profoundly altered: the quality, the nature, in a sense the substance 
of which the punishable element is made, rather than its formal 
definition. Undercover of the relative stability of the law, a mass of 
subtle and rapid changes has occurred. Certain.y the ‘crimes’ and 
‘offences’ on which judgement is passed are juridical objects defined 
by the code, but judgement is also passed on the passions, instincts, 
anomalies, infirmities, maladjustments, effects of environment or 
heredity; acts of aggression are punished, so also, through them, is 
aggressivity; rape, but at the same time perversions; murders, but 
also drives and desires. But, it will be objected, judgement is not 
actually being passed on them; if they are referred to at all it is to 
explain the actions in question, and to determine to what extent the 
the subject’s will was involved in the crime. This is no answer. For 
it is these shadows lurking behind the case itself that are judged and 
punished. They are judged indirectly as 'attenuating circumstances’ 
that introduce into the verdict not only ‘circumstantial’ evidence,

but something quite different, which is not juridically codifiable: 
the knowledge of the criminal, one’s estimation of him, what is 
known about the relations between him, his past and his crime, and 
what might be expected of him in the future. They are also judged 
by the interplay of all those notions that have circulated between 
medicine and jurisprudence since the nineteenth century (the ‘mon¬ 
sters’ of Georget’s times, Chaumie’s ‘psychical anomalies’, the 
‘perverts’ and ‘maladjusted’ of our own experts) and which, behind 
the pretext of explaining an action, are ways of defining an indivi¬ 
dual. They are punished by means of a punishment that has the 
function of making the offender ‘not only desirous, but also capable, 
oi living within the law and of providing for his own needs’; they 
are punished by the internal economy of a penalty which, while 
intended to punish the crime, may be altered (shortened or, in 
certain cases, extended) according to changes in the prisoner’s 
behaviour; and they are punished by the ‘security measures’ that 
accompany the penalty (prohibition of entering certain areas, pro¬ 
bation, obligatory medical treatment), and which are intended not 
to punish the offence, but to supetvise die individual, to neutralize 
his dangerous state of mind, to alter his criminal tendencies, and to 
continue even when this change has been achieved. The criminal’s 
soul is not referred to in the trial merely to explain his crime and 
as a factor in the juridical apportioning of responsibility; if it is 
brought before the court, with such pomp and circumstance, such 
concern to understand and such ‘scientific’ application, it is because 
it too, as well as the crime itself, is to be judged and to share in the 
punishment. Throughout the penal ritual, from the preliminary 
investigation to the sentence and the final effects of the penalty, a 
domain has been penetrated by objects that not only duplicate, but 
also dissociate the juridically defined and coded objects. Psychiatric 
expertise, but also in a more general way criminal anthropology and 
the repetitive discourse of criminology, find one of their precise 
functions here: by solemnly inscribing offences in the field of objects 
susceptible of scientific knowledge, they provide the mechanisms 
of legal punishment with a justifiable hold not only on offences, but 
on individuals; not only on what they do, but also on what they are, 
will be, may be. The additional factor of the offender’s soul, which 
the legal system has laid hold of, is only apparently explanatory 


and limitative, and is in fact expansionist. During the 150 or 200 
years that Europe has been setting up its new penal systems, the 
judges have gradually, by means of a process that goes back very far 
indeed, taken to judging something other than crimes, namely, the 
‘soul’ of the criminal. 

And, by that very fact, they have begun to do something other 
than pass judgement. Or, to be more precise, within the very judicial 
modality of judgement, other types of assessment have slipped in, 
profoundly altering its rules of elaboration. Ever since the Middle 
Ages slowly and painfully built up the great procedure of investiga¬ 
tion, to judge was to establish the truth of a crime, it was to deter¬ 
mine its author and to apply a legal punishment. Knowledge of the 
offence, knowledge of the offender, knowledge of the law: these 
three conditions made it possible to ground a judgement in truth. 
But now a quite different question of truth is inscribed in the course 
of the penal judgement. The question is no longer simply: ‘Has the 
act been established and is it punishable?’ But also: ‘What is this act, 
what is this act of violence or this murder? To what level or to what 
field of reality does it belong? Is it a phantasy, a psychotic reaction, a 
delusional episode, a perverse action?' It is no longer simply: ‘Who 
committed it?’ But: 'How can we assign the causal process that 
produced it? Where did it originate in the author himself? Instinct, 
unconscious, environment, heredity?’ It is no longer simply: 'What 
law punishes this offence?’ But: 'What would be die most appropriate 
measures to take? How do we see the future development of the 
offender? What would be the best way of rehabilitating him?’ A 
whole set of assessing, diagnostic, prognostic, normative judge¬ 
ments concerning the criminal have become lodged in the frame¬ 
work of penal judgement. Another truth has penetrated the truth 
that was required by the legal machinery; a truth which, entangled 
with the first, has turned the assertion of guilt into a strange 
scienufico-juridical complex. A significant fact is :he way in which 
the quesdon of madness has evolved in penal practice. According 
to the 1810 code, madness was dealt with only in terms of article 64. 
Now this article states that there is neither crime nor offence if the 
offender was of unsound mind at the time of the act. The possibility 
of ascertaining madness was, therefore, a quite separate matter from 
the definition of an act as a crime; the gravity of the act was not

The body of the condemned 


altered by the fact that its author was insane, nor the punishment 
reduced as a consequence; the crime itself disappeared. It was im¬ 
possible, therefore, to declare that someone was both guilty and 
mad; once the diagnosis of madness had been accepted, it could not 
be included in the judgement; it interrupted the procedure and 
loosened the hold of the law on the author of the act. Not only the 
examination of the criminal suspected of insanity, but die very 
effects of this examination had to be external and anterior to the 
sentence. But, very soon, the courts of the nineteenth century began 
to misunderstand the meaning of article 64. Despite several decisions 
of the supreme court of appeal confirming that insanity could not 
result either in a light penalty, or even in an acquittal, but required 
that the case be dismissed, the ordinary courts continued to bring 
the question of insanity to bear on their verdicts. They accepted 
that one could be both guilty and mad; less guilty the madder one 
was; guilty certainly, but someone to be put away and treated rather 
than punished; not only a guilty man, but also dangerous, since 
quite obviously sick, etc. From the point of view of the penal code, 
the result was a mass of juridical absurdities. But this was the starting 
point of an evolution that jurisprudence and legislation itself was to 
precipitate in the course of the next 150 years: already the reform 
of 1832, introducing attenuating circumstances, made it possible to 
modify the sentence according to the supposed degrees of an illness 
or the forms of a semi-insanity. And the practice of calling on 
psychiatric expertise, which is widespread in the assize courts and 
sometimes extended to courts of summary jurisdiction, means that 
the sentence, even if it is always formulated in terms of legal punish¬ 
ment, implies, more or less obscurely, judgements of normality, 
attributions of causality, assessments of possible changes, anticipa¬ 
tions as to the offender's future. It would be wrong to say that all 
these operations give substance to a judgement from the outside; 
they are directly integrated in the process of forming the sentence. 
Instead of insanity eliminating the crime according to the original 
meaning of article 64, every crime and even every offence now 
carries within it, as a legitimate suspicion, but also as a right that may 
be claimed, the hypothesis of insanity, in any case of anomaly. And 
the sentence that condemns or acquits is not simply a judgement of 
guilt, a legal decision that lays down punishment; it bears within it 


an assessment of normality and a technical prescription for a possible 
normalization. Today the judge - magistrate or jurar - certainly does 
more than 'judge’. 

And he is not alone in judging. Throughout the penal procedure 
and the implementation of the sentence there swarms a whole 
series of subsidiary authorities. Small-scale legal systems and 
parallel judges have multiplied around the principal judgement: 
psychiatric or psychological experts, magistrates concerned with 
the implementation of sentences, educationalists, members of the 
prison service, all fragment the legal power to punish; it might be 
objected that none of them really shares the right tc judge; that some, 
after sentence is passed, have no other right than to implement the 
punishment laid down by the court and, above all, that others - the 
experts - intervene before the sentence not to pass judgement, but 
to assist tile judges in their decision. But as soon as the penalties and 
the security measures defined by the court are not absolutely deter¬ 
mined, from the moment they may be modified along the way, 
from the moment one leaves to others than the judges of the offence 
the task of deciding whether the condemned man 'deserves' to be 
placed in semi-liberty or conditional liberty, whether they may 
bring his penal tutelage to an end, one is handing over to them 
mechanisms of legal punishment to be used at their discretion: 
subsidiary judges they may be, but they are judges all the same. 
The whole machinery that has been developing for years around 
the implementation of sentences, and their adjustment to individuals, 
creates a proliferation of the authorities of judicial decision-making 
and extends its powers of decision well beyond the sentence. The 
psychiatric experts, for their part, may well refrain from judging. 
Let us examine the three questions to which, since the 1958 ruling, 
they have to address themselves: Does the convicted person repre¬ 
sent a danger to society? Is he susceptible to penal punishment? Is he 
curable or readjustable? These questions have nothing to do with 
article 64, nor with the possible insanity of the convicted person at 
the moment of the act. They do not concern ‘responsibility’. They 
concern nothing but the administration of the penalty, its necessity, 
its usefulness, its possible effectiveness; they make it possible to 
show, in an almost transparent vocabulary, whether the mental hos¬ 
pital w’ould be a more suitable place of confinement than the prison,

whether this confinement should be short or long, whether medical 
treatment or security measures are called for. What, then, is the role 
of the psychiatrist in penal matters? He is not an expert in responsi¬ 
bility, but an adviser on punishment; it is up to him to say whether 
the subject is ‘dangerous', in what way one should be protected 
from him, how one should intervene to alter him, whether it would 
be better to try to force him into submission or to treat him. At the 
very beginning of its history, psychiatric expertise was called upon 
to formulate ‘true’ propositions as to the part that the liberty of the 
offender had played in the act he had committed; it is now called 
upon to suggest a prescription for what might be called his ‘medico- 
judicial treatment’. 

To sum up, ever since the new penal system - that defined by the 
great codes of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries - has been in 
operation, a general process has led judges to judge something 
other than crimes; they have been led in their sentences to do some¬ 
thing other than judge; and the power of judging has been trans¬ 
ferred, in part, to other authorities than the judges of the offence. 
The whole penal operation has taken on exiia-jiuidical elements and 

personnel. It will be said that there is nothing extraordinary in this, 
that it is part of the destiny of the law' to absorb little by little 
elements that are alien to it. But what is odd about modern criminal 
justice is that, although it has taken on so many extra-juridical 
elements, it has done so not in order to be able to define them 
juridically and gradually to integrate them into the actual power to 
punish: on the contrary, it has done so in order to make them func¬ 
tion within the penal operation as non-juridical elements; in order 
to stop this operation being simply a legal punishment; in order to 
exculpate the judge from being purely and simply he who punishes. 
‘Of course, we pass sentence, but this sentence is not in direct 
relation to the crime. It is quite clear that for us it functions as a way 
of treating a criminal. We punish, but this is a w'ay of saying that 
we W'ish to obtain a cure.’ Today, criminal justice functions and 
justifies itself only by this perpetual reference to something other 
than itself, by this unceasing reinscription in non-juridical systems. 
Its fate is to be redefined by knowledge. 

Beneath the increasing leniency of punishment, then, one may 
map a displacement of its point of application; and through this 

22 


displacement, a whole field of recent objects, a whole new system of 
truth and a mass of roles hitherto unknown in the exercise of criminal 
justice. A corpus of know ledge, techniques, ‘scientific’ discourses is 
formed and becomes entangled with the practice of the power to 
punish. 

This book is intended as a correlative history of the modem soul 
and of a new' power to judge; a genealogy of the present scientifico- 
legal complex from which the power to punish derives its bases, 
justifications and rules, from which it extends its effects and by which 
it masks its exorbitant singularity. 

But from what point can such a history of the modem soul on 
trial be written? If one confined oneself to the evolution of legisla¬ 
tion or of penal procedures, one would run the risk of allowing a 
change in the collective sensibility, an increase in humanization or 
the development of the human sciences to emerge as a massive, 
external, inert and primary fact. By studying only the general social 
forms, as Durkheim did (cf. Bibliography), one runs the risk of 
positing as the principle of greater leniency in punishment pro¬ 
cesses of individualization that are rather one of the effects of die 
new tactics of power, among which arc to be included the new penal 
mechanisms. This study obeys four general rules: 

1. Do not concentrate the study of the punitive mechanisms on 
their ‘repressive’ effects alone, on their ‘punishment’ aspects alone, 
but situate them in a whole series of their possible positive effects, 
even if these seem marginal at first sight. As a consequence, regard 
punishment as a complex social function. 

2. Analyse punitive methods not simply as consequences of 
legislation or as indicators of social structures, but as techniques 
possessing their own specificity in the more general field of other 
w'ays of exercising power. Regard punishment as a political tactic. 

3. Instead of treating the history of penal law and the history of 
the human sciences as two separate series whose overlapping appears 
to have had on one or the other, or perhaps on both, a disturbing 
or useful effect, according to one’s point of view, see whether there 
is not some common matrix or whether they do not both derive 
from a single process of ‘epistemologico-juridical’ formation; in 
short, make the technology of power the very principle both of the 
humanization of the penal system and of the knowledge of man.

4. Try to discover whether this entry of the soul on to the scene 
of penal justice, and with it the insertion in legal practice of a whole 
corpus of‘scientific’ knowledge, is not the effect of a transformation 
of the way in which the body itself is invested by power relations. 

In short, try to study the metamorphosis of punitive methods on 
the basis of a political technology of the body in which might be 
read a common history of power relations and object relations. 
Thus, by an analysis of penal leniency as a technique of power, 
one might understand both how man, the soul, the normal or 
abnormal individual have come to duplicate crime as objects of 
penal intervention; and in what way a specific mode of subjection 
was able to give birth to man as an object of knowledge for a dis¬ 
course with a ‘scientific’ status. 

But I am not claiming to be the first to have worked in this 
direction. 2 

Rusche and Kirchheimer’s great work, Punishment and Social 
Structures , provides a number of essential reference points. We must 
first rid ourselves of the illusion that penality is above all (if not 
exclusively) a means of reducing crime and that, in this role, accord¬ 
ing to the social forms, the political systems or beliefs, it may be 
severe or lenient, tend towards expiation of obtaining redress, to¬ 
wards the pursuit of individuals or the attribution of collective 
responsibility. We must analyse rather the ‘concrete systems of 
punishment’, study them as social phenomena that cannot be 
accounted for by the juridical structure of society alone, nor by its 
fundamental ethical choices; we must situate them in their field of 
operation, in which the punishment of crime is not the sole element; 
we must show that punitive measures are not simply ‘negative’ 
mechanisms that make it possible to repress, to prevent, to exclude, 
to eliminate; but that they are linked to a whole series of positive 
and useful effects which it is their task to support (and, in this sense, 
although legal punishment is carried out in order to punish offences, 
one might say that the definition of offences and their prosecution 
are carried out in turn in order to maintain the punitive mechanisms 
and their functions). From this point of view, Rusche and Kirch- 
heimer relate the different systems of punishment with the systems 
of production within which they operate: thus, in a slave economy, 


punitive mechanisms serve to provide an additional labour force - 
and to constitute a body of‘civil’ slaves in addition to those provided 
by war or trading; with feudalism, at a time when money and pro¬ 
duction were still at an early stage of development, we find a sudden 
increase in corporal punishments - the body being in most cases the 
only property accessible; the penitentiary (the Hopital General, the 
Spinhuis or the Rasphuis), forced labour and the prison factory 
appear with the development of the mercantile economy. But the 
industrial system requires a free market in labour and, in the nine¬ 
teenth century, the role of forced labour in the mechanisms of 
punishment diminishes accordingly and ‘corrective’ detention takes 
its place. There are no doubt a number of observations to be made 
about such a strict correlation. 

But we can surely accept the general proposition that, in our 
societies, the systems of punishment are to be situated in a certain 
‘political economy’ of the body: even if they do not make use of 
violent or bloody punishment, even when they use ‘lenient’ methods 
involving confinement or correction, it is always the body that is at 
issue the body and its forces, their utility and their docility, their 
distribution and their submission. It is certainly legitimate to write 
a history- of punishment against the background of moral ideas or 
legal structures. But can one write such a history against the back¬ 
ground of a history of bodies, when such systems of punishment 
claim to have only the secret souls of criminals as their objective? 

Historians long ago began to write the history of the body. They 
have studied the body in the field of historical demography or 
pathology; they have considered it as the seat of needs and appetites, 
as the locus of physiological processes and metabolisms, as a target 
for the attacks of germs or viruses; they have shown to what extent 
historical processes were involved in what might seem to be the 
purely biological base of existence; and what place should be given 
in the history of society to biological ‘events’ such as the circulation 
of bacilli, or the extension of the life-span (cf. Le Roy-Ladurie). 
But the body is also directly involved in a political field; power 
relations have an immediate hold upon it; they invest it, mark it, 
train it, torture it, force it to carry out tasks, to perform ceremonies, 
to emit signs. This political investment of the body is bound up, 
in accordance with complex reciprocal relations, with its economic

use; it is largely as a force of production that the body is invested 
with relations of power and domination; but, on the other hand, its 
constitution as labour power is possible only if it is caught up in a 
system of subjection (in which need is also a political instrument 
meticulously prepared, calculated and used); the body becomes a 
useful force only if it is both a productive body and a subjected body. 
This subjection is not only obtained by the instruments of violence 
or ideology; it can also be direct, physical, pitting force against 
force, bearing on material elements, and yet without involving 
violence; it may be calculated, organized, technically thought out; 
it may be subtle, make use neither of weapons nor of terror and yet 
remain of a physical order. That is to say, there may be a ‘knowledge* 
of the body that is not exactly the science of its functioning, and a 
mastery of its forces that is more than the ability to conquer them: 
this knowledge and this mastery constitute what might be called the 
political technology of the body. Of course, this technology is 
diffuse, rarely formulated in continuous, systematic discourse; it is 
often made up of bits and pieces; it implements a disparate set of 
tools or methods. In spite of the coherence uf iu> iesulu», it is 
generally no more than a multiform instrumentation. Moreover, it 
cannor be localized in a particular type of institution or state 
apparatus. For they have recourse to it; they use, select or impose 
certain of its methods. But, in its mechanisms and its effects, it is 
situated at a quite different level. What the apparatuses and institu¬ 
tions operate is, in a sense, a micro-physics of power, whose field 
of validity is situated in a sense between these great functionings 
and the bodies themselves with their materiality and their forces. 

Now, the study of this micro-physics presupposes that the power 
exercised on the body is conceived not as a property, but as a 
strategy, that its effects of domination are attributed not to ‘appro¬ 
priation’, but to dispositions, manoeuvres, tactics, techniques, 
functionings; that one should decipher in it a network of relations, 
constantly in tension, in activity, rather than a privilege that one 
might possess; that one should take as its model a perpetual battle 
rather than a contract regulating a transaction or the conquest of a 
territory. In short this power is exercised rather than possessed; 
it is nor the ‘privilege’, acquired or preserved, of the dominant 
class, but the overall effect of its strategic positions - an effect that 


is manifested and sometimes extended by the position of those who 
are dominated. Furthermore, this power is not exercised simply as 
an obligation or a prohibition on those who ‘do not have it’; it 
invests them, is transmitted by them and through them; it exerts 
pressure upon them, just as they themselves, in their struggle against 
it, resist the grip it has on them. This means that these relations go 
right down into the depths of society, that they are not localized in 
the relations between the state and its citizens or on the frontier 
between classes and that they do not merely reproduce, at the level 
of individuals, bodies, gestures and behaviour, the general form of 
the law or government; that, although there is continuity (they are 
indeed articulated on this form through a whole series of complex 
mechanisms), there is neither analogy nor homology, but a specific¬ 
ity of mechanism and modality. Lastly, they are not univocal; they 
define innumerable points of confrontation, focuses of instability, 
each of which has its own risks of conflict, of struggles, and of an 
at least temporary inversion of the power relations. The overthrow 
of these ‘micro-powers’ does not, then, obey the law of all or 
nothing; it is not acquired once and for all by a new control of the 
apparatuses nor by a new functioning or a destruction of the in¬ 
stitutions; on the other hand, none of its localized episodes may be 
inscribed in history except by the effects that it induces on the entire 
network in which it is caught up. 

Perhaps, too, we should abandon a whole tradition that allows 
us to imagine that knowledge can exist only where the power rela¬ 
tions are suspended and that knowledge can develop only outside its 
injunctions, its demands and its interests. Perhaps we should aban¬ 
don the belief that power makes mad and that, by the same token, 
the renunciation of power is one of the conditions of knowledge. 
We should admit rather that power produces knowledge (and not 
simply by encouraging it because it serves power or by applying it 
because it is useful); that power and knowledge directly imply one 
another; that there is no power relation without the correlative 
constitution of a field of knowledge, nor any knowledge that does 
not presuppose and constitute at the same time power relations. 
These ‘power-knowledge relations’ are to be analysed, therefore, 
not on the basis of a subject of knowledge who is or is not free in 
relation to the power system, but, on the contrary, the subject who

knows, the objects to be known and the modalities of knowledge 
must be regarded as so many effects of these fundamental implica¬ 
tions of power-knowledge and their historical transformations. In 
short, it is nor the activity of the subject of knowledge that pro¬ 
duces a corpus of knowledge, useful or resistant to power, bur 
power-knowledge, the processes and struggles that traverse it and 
of which it is made up, that determines the forms and possible 
domains of knowledge. 

To analyse the political investment of the body and the micro¬ 
physics of power presupposes, therefore, that one abandons - where 
power is concerned - the violence-ideology opposition, the meta¬ 
phor of property, the model of the contract or of conquest; that - 
where knowledge is concerned - one abandons the opposition 
between what is ‘interested’ and what is ‘disinterested’, the model of 
knowledge and the primacy of the subject. Borrowing a word from 
Petty and his contemporaries, but giving it a different meaning from 
the one current in the seventeenth century, one might imagine a 
political ‘anatomy’. This would not be the study of a state in terms of 

a ‘body’ (with itc elcmcnt3, its resources and its foiecs), nor would 

it be the study of the body and its surroundings in terms of a small 
state. One would be concerned with the ‘body politic’, as a set of 
material elements and techniques that serve as weapons, relays, 
communication routes and supports for the power and knowledge 
relations that invest human bodies and subjugate them by turning 
them into objects of knowledge. 

It is a question of situating the techniques of punishment - 
whether they seize the body in the ritual of public torture and 
execudon or whether they are addressed to the soul - in the history 
of this body politic; of considering penal practices less as a conse¬ 
quence of legal theories than as a chapter of political anatomy. 

Kantorowitz gives a remarkable analysis of ‘The King’s Body’: 
a double body according to the juridical theology of the Middle 
Ages, since it involves not only the transitory element that is bom 
and dies, but another that remains unchanged by time and is main¬ 
tained as the physical yet intangible support of the kingdom; 
around this duality, which was originally close to the Christological 
model, are organized an iconography, a political theory of monarchy, 
legal mechanisms that distinguish between as well as link the person 







of the king and the demands of the Crown, and a whole ritual that 
reaches its height in the coronation, the funeral and the ceremonies 
of submission. At the opposite pole one might imagine placing the 
body of the condemned man; he, too, has his legal status; he gives 
rise to his own ceremonial and he calls forth a whole theoretical 
discourse, not in order to ground the ‘surplus power’ possessed by 
the person of the sovereign, but in order to code the 'lack of power’ 
with which those subjected to punishment are marked. In the darkest 
region of the political field the condemned man represents the sym¬ 
metrical, inverted figure of the king. We should analyse what might 
be called, in homage to Kantorowitz, ‘the least body of the con¬ 
demned man’. 

If the surplus power possessed by the king gives rise to die 
duplication of his body, has not the surplus power exercised on the 
subjected body of the condemned man given rise to another type of 
duplication? That of a ‘non-corporal’, a ‘soul’, as Mably called it. 
The history of this ‘micro-physics’ of the punitive power would then 
be a genealogy or an element in a genealogy of the modern ‘soul’. 
Rather than seeing this soul as the reactivated remnants of an ideu- 
logy, one would see it as the present correlative of a certain tech¬ 
nology of power over the body. It would be wrong to say that the 
soul is an illusion, or an ideological effect. On the contrary, it exists, 
it has a reality, it is produced permanently around, on, within the 
body by the functioning of a power that is exercised on those 
punished - and, in a more general way, on those one supervises, 
trains and corrects, over madmen, children at hone and at school, 
the colonized, over those who are stuck at a machine and supervised 
for the rest of their lives. This is the historical reality of this soul, 
which, unlike the soul represented by Christian theology, is not 
born in sin and subject to punishment, but is born rather out of 
methods of punishment, supervision and constraint. This real, non- 
corporal soul is not a substance; it is the element in which are 
articulated the effects of a certain type of power and the reference 
of a certain type of knowledge, the machinery by which the power 
relations give rise to a possible corpus of knowledge, and knowledge 
extends and reinforces the effects of this power. On this reality- 
reference, various concepts have been constructed and domains of 
analysis carved out: psyche, subjectivity, personally, consciousness,

Torture 


The body of the condemned 


etc.; on it have been built scientific techniques and discourses, 
and the moral claims of humanism. But let there be no misunder¬ 
standing: it is not that a real man, the object of knowledge, philo¬ 
sophical reflection or technical intervention, has been substituted 
for the soul, the illusion of the theologians. The man described for 
us, whom we are invited to free, is already in himself the effect of a 
subjection much more profound than himself. A ‘soul’ inhabits him 
and brings him to existence, which is itself a factor in the mastery 
that power exercises over the body. The soul is the effect and 
instrument of a political anatomy; the soul is the prison of the body. 

That punishment in general and the prison in particular belong 
to a political technology of the body is a lesson that I have learnt 
not so much from history as from the present. In recent years, 
prison revolts have occurred throughout the world. There was cer¬ 
tainly something paradoxical about their aims, their slogans and the 
way they took place. They were revolts against an entire state of 
physical misery that is over a century old: against cold, suffocation 
and overcrowding, against decrepit walls, hunger, physical mal¬ 
treatment. But they were also revolts against model prisons, tran¬ 
quillizers, isolation, the medical or educational services. Were they 
revolts whose aims were merely material? Or contradictory revolts: 
against the obsolete, but also against comfort; against the warders, 
but also against the psychiatrists? In fact, all these movements - and 
the innumerable discourses that the prison has given rise to since 
the early nineteenth century - have been about the body and 
material things. What has sustained these discourses, these mem¬ 
ories and invectives are indeed those minute material details. One 
may, if one is so disposed, see them as no more than blind demands 
or suspect the existence behind them of alien strategies. In fact, they 
w'ere revolts, at the level of the body, against the very body of the 
prison. What was at issue was not whether the prison environment 
was too harsh or too aseptic, too primitive or too efficient, but its 
very materiality as an instrument and vector of power; it is this 
whole technology of power over the body that the technology of 
the ‘soul’ - that of the educationalists, psychologists and psychia¬ 
trists - fails either to conceal or to compensate, for the simple reason 
that it is one of its tools. I would like to write the history of this 


prison, with all the political investments of the body that it gathers 
together in its closed architecture. Why? Simply because I am 
interested in the past? No, if one means by that writing a history of 
the past in terms of the present. Yes, if one means writing the 
history of the present . 3 








The spectacle of the scaffold 


2. The spectacle of the scaffold 


The ordinance of 1670 regulated the general forms of penal practice 
up to the Revolution. It laid down the following hierarchy of 
penalties: ‘Death, judicial torture pending proof, penal servitude, 
flogging, amende honorable , banishment.’ A high proportion of 
physical punishment. Customs, the nature of the crimes, the status 
of the condemned accounted for still more variations. ‘Capital 
punishment comprises many kinds of death: some prisoners may be 
condemned to be hanged, others to having their hands cut off or 
their tongues cut out or pierced and then to be hanged; others, for 
more serious crimes, to be broken alive and to die on the wheel, 

after having their limbs broken; others to be broken until they die 
a natural death, others to be strangled and then broken, others to 
be burnt alive, others to be burnt after first being strangled; others 
to be drawn by four horses, others to have their heads cut off, and 
others to have their heads broken’ (Soulatges, 169-71). And Sou- 
latges adds, almost in passing, that there are also lighter penalties 
not mentioned by the ordinance: satisfaction to the injured party, 
warning, reprimand, a short period of imprisonment, prohibition 
from entering a certain area and, lastly, pecuniary punishments - 
fines or confiscation. 

But we must not be misled. There was a considerable gap between 
this arsenal of horrors and everyday penal practice. Public torture 
and execution was by no means the most frequent form of punish¬ 
ment. To us today the proportion of death sentences in the penal 
practice of the classical age may seem high: at the Chatelet 1 during 
the period 1755-85 under 10 per cent of the sentences passed in¬ 
volved capital punishment: die wheel, the gallows or the stake 
(Petrovitch, 226ff); the Parlement of Flanders passed thirty-nine 
death sentences, out of a total of 260 sentences, between 1721 and 


1730 (and twenty-six out of 500 between 1781 and 1790 - cf. 
Dautricourt). But it must not be forgotten that :he courts found 
many ways of relaxing the rigours of the penal system, either by 
refusing to prosecute offences that were too heavily punished or by 
modifying the definition of the crime; sometimes too the royal 
power indicated that some particularly severe ordinance was not to 
be applied too strictly (which was how Choiseul dealt with the 
declaration of 3 August 1744 on vagabonds - Choiseul, 128-9). 
In any case, the majority of the sentences involved banishment or 
fines: in a court such as that of the Chatelet (which dealt only with 
relatively serious offences), banishment represented over half the 
sentences passed between 1755 an<1 *785- But man Y these non_ 
corporal penalties were accompanied by additional penalties that 
involved a degree of torture: public exhibition, pillory, carcan, 
flogging, branding; this was the case for all sentences to the ‘galleys’ 
or to what was the equivalent for women - reclusion in the hospital; 
banishment was often preceded by public exhibition and branding; 
fines were sometimes accompanied by flogging. It was not only in 
the great solemn executions, but also in this additional form of 
punishment, that torture revealed the significant part it played in 
penality: every penalty of a certain seriousness had to involve an 
element of torture, of supphee. 

What is a supplied* ‘Corporal punishment, painful to a more or 
less horrible degree,’ said Jaucourt in his Encydopidie article and 
added: ‘It is an inexplicable phenomenon that the extension of 
man’s imagination creates out of the barbarous and the cruel.’ 
Inexplicable, perhaps, but certainly neither irregular nor primitive. 
Torture is a technique; it is not an extreme expression of lawless 
rage. To be torture, punishment must obey three principal criteria: 
first, it must produce a certain degree of pain, which may be meas¬ 
ured exactly, or at least calculated, compared and hierarchized; 
death is a torture in so far as it is not simply a withdrawal of the 
right to live, but is the occasion and the culmination of a calculated 
gradation of pain: from decapitation (which reduces all pain to a 
single gesture, performed in a single moment - the zero degree of 
torture), through hanging, the stake and the wheel (all of which 
prolong the agony), to quartering, which carries pain almost 
to infinity; death-torture is the art of maintaining life in pain, by

subdividing it into a 'thousand deaths’, by achieving before life 
ceases 'the most exquisite agonies’ (cf. Ollyffe). Torture rests on a 
whole quantitative art of pain. But there is more to it: this production 
of pain is regulated. Torture correlates the type of corporal effect, the 
quality, intensity, duration of pain, with the gravity of the crime, 
the person of the criminal, the rank of his victims. There is a legal 
code of pain; when it involves torture, punishment does not fall 
upon the body indiscriminately or equally; it is calculated according 
to detailed rules: the number of lashes of the whip, the positioning 
of the branding iron, the duration of the death agony on the stake 
or the wheel (the court decides whether the criminal is to be 
strangled at once or allowed to die slowly,, and the points at which 
this gesture of pity must occur), the type of mutilation to be used 
(hand cut off, lips or tongue pierced). All these various elements 
multiply the punishments and are combined according to the court 
and the crime. ‘The poetry of Dante put into laws,’ was how Rossi 
described it; a long course in physico-penal knowledge, in any case. 
Furthermore, torture forms part of a ritual. It is an element in the 
liturgy of punishment and meets two demands. It must mark the 
victim: it is intended, either by the scar it leaves on the body, or by 
the spectacle that accompanies it, to brand the victim with infamy; 
even if its function is to ‘purge’ the crime, torture does not recon¬ 
cile; it traces around or, rather, on the very body of the condemned 
man signs that must not be effaced; in any case, men will remember 
public exhibition, the pillory, torture and pain duly observed. And, 
from the point of view of the law that imposes it, public torture and 
execution must be spectacular, it must be seen by all almost as its 
triumph. The very excess of the violence employed is one of the 
elements of its glory: the fact that the guilty man should moan and 
cry out under the blows is not a shameful side-effect, it is the very 
ceremonial of justice being expressed in all its force. Hence no doubt 
those tortures that take place even after death: corpses burnt, ashes 
thrown to the winds, bodies dragged on hurdles and exhibited at 
the roadside. Justice pursues the body beyond all possible pain. 

The term ‘penal torture’ does not cover any corporal punishment: 
it is a differentiated production of pain, an organized ritual for the 
marking of victims and the expression of the power that punishes; 
not the expression of a legal system driven to exasperation and, 


forgetting its principles, losing all restraint. In the ‘excesses’ of 
torture, a whole economy of power is invested. 

The tortured body is first inscribed in the legal ceremonial that 
must produce, open for all to see, the truth of the ctime. 

In France, as in most European countries, with the notable 
exception of England, the entire criminal procedure, right up to the 
sentence, remained secret: that is to say, opaque, not only to the 
public but also to the accused himself. It took place without him, 
or at least without his having any knowledge either of the charges 
or of the evidence. In the order of criminal justice, knowledge was 
the absolute privilege of the prosecution. The preliminary’ investiga¬ 
tion was carried out 'as diligently and secretly as may be’, as the edict 
of 1498 put it. According to the ordinance of 1670, which confirmed 
and, on certain points, reinforced the severity of the preceding 
period, it was impossible for the accused to have access to the docu¬ 
ments of the case, impossible to know the identity of his accusers, 
impossible to know the nature of the evidence before objecting to 
witnesses, impossible to make use, until the last moments of the 
trial, of the documents in proof, impossible to have a lawyer, either 
to ensure the proper conduct of the case, or to take parr, on the 
main issue, in the defence. The magistrate, for his part, had the 
right to accept anonymous denunciations, to conceal from the ac¬ 
cused the nature of the action, to question him with a view to 
catching him out, to use insinuations. (Up to the eighteenth century, 
lengthy arguments took place as to whether, in the course of 
‘captious’ questioning, it was lawful for the judge to use false 
promises, lies, words with double meaning - a whole casuistry of 
legal bad faith.) The magistrate constituted, in solitary omnipotence, 
a truth by which he invested the accused; and the ;udges received 
this truth ready made, in the form of documents and written state¬ 
ments; for them, these factors alone were proof; they met the 
accused only once in order to question him before passing sentence. 
The secret and w'ritten form of the procedure reflects the principle 
that in criminal matters the establishment of truth was the absolute 
right and the exclusive power of die sovereign and his judges. 
Ayrault supposed that this procedure (which was more or less 
established by the sixteenth century) originated in ‘the fear of die 



Torture

uproar, shouting and cheering that the people usually indulge in, 
the fear that there would be disorder, violence, and outbursts against 
the parties, or even against the judges’; the king wished to show in 
this that the ‘sovereign power’ from which the right to punish 
derived could in no case belong to the ‘multitude’ (cf. Ayrault, 
LIII, chapters LXXII and LXIX). Before the justice of the sover¬ 
eign, all voices must be still. 

Yet, despite the use of secrecy, certain rules had to be obeyed in 
establishing the truth. Secrecy itself required that a rigorous model 
of penal truth be defined. A whole tradition dating from the Middle 
Ages and considerably developed by the great lawyers of the 
Renaissance laid down what the nature and the use of evidence 
might be. Even in the eighteenth century, it was still common to 
meet distinctions like the following: true, direct, or legitimate proof 
(that provided by witnesses, for example) and indirect, conjectural, 
artificial proof (obtained by argument); or, again, manifest proof, 
considerable proof, imperfect or slight (Jousse, 660); or, again, 
‘urgent or necessary’ proof that did not allow one to doubt the 
truth of the deed (this was 'lull' proof: thus two irreproachable wit¬ 
nesses affirming that they saw die accused, carrying an unsheathed 
and bloody sword, leave the place where, some time later, the body 
of the dead man was found with stab wounds); approximate or semi¬ 
full proof, which may be regarded as true as long as the accused does 
not destroy it with evidence to the contrary (die evidence of a single 
eye-witness or deadi threats preceding a murder); lastly, distant or 
‘ adminicule ’ clues, which consisted only of opinion (rumour, the 
flight of the suspect, his manner when questioned, etc. - Muyart de 
Vouglans, 1757, 345-7)- Now, these distinctions are not simply 
theoretical subtleties. They have an operational function. First, 
because each of these kinds of evidence, taken in isolation, may have 
a particular type of judicial effect: ‘full’ proof may lead to any 
sentence; ‘semi-full’ proof may lead to any of the ‘peines afflictives', 
or heavy penalties, except death; imperfect and slight clues are 
enough for the suspect to have a writ issued against him, to have 
the case deferred for further inquiry or to have a fine imposed on 
him. Secondly, because they are combined according to precise 
arithmetical rules: two ‘semi-full’ proofs may make a complete proof; 

‘ adminicules ', providing there are several of them and they concur, 

36 


may be combined to form a semi-proof; but, however many there 
may be of them, they can never, of themselves, constitute a complete 
proof. Wc have, then, a penal arithmetic that is meticulous on many 
points, but which still leaves a margin for a good deal of argument: in 
order for a capital sentence to be passed, is a single full proof enough 
or must it be accompanied by other slighter clues? Are two approxi¬ 
mate proofs always equivalent to a full proof? Should not three be 
required or two plus distant clues? Are there elements that may be 
regarded as clues only for certain crimes, in certain circumstances 
and in relation to certain persons (thus evidence is disregarded if it 
comes from a vagabond; it is reinforced, on the contrary, if it is 
provided by ‘a considerable person’ or by a master in the case of a 
domestic offence). It is an arithmetic modulated by casuistry, whose 
function is to define how a legal proof is to be constructed. On the 
one hand, this system of ‘legal proofs’ makes truth in the penal 
domain the result of a complex art; it obeys rules known only to 
specialists, and, consequently, it reinforces the principle of secrecy. 
‘It is not enough that the judge should have the conviction that any 
reasonable man may have. . . Nothing is more incorrect than this 
way of judging, which, in truth, is no other than a more or less well- 

( founded opinion.’ But, on the other hand, it is a severe constraint 
for the magistrate; in the absence of this regularity, ‘every sentence 
would be reckless, and in a sense it may be said that it is unjust even 
when, in truth, the accused is guilty’ (Poullain du Parc, 112-13 - see 
also Esmein, 260-83 and Mittermaier, 15—19). The day will come 
when the singularity of this judicial truth will appear scandalous: 
as if the law did not have to obey the rules of common truth. ‘What 
would be said of a semi-proof in the sciences capable of demonstra¬ 
tion? What would a geometrical or algebraic semi-proof amount 
to?’ (Seigneux de Correvon, 63). But it should not be forgotten 
that these formal constraints on legal proof were a mode of regula¬ 
tion internal to absolute power and exclusive of knowledge. 

Written, secret, subjected, in order to construct its proofs, to 
rigorous rules, the penal investigation was a machine that might 
produce the truth in the absence of the accused. And by this very 
fact, though the law strictly speaking did not require it, this pro¬ 
cedure was to tend necessarily to the confession. And for two 
reasons: first, because the confession constituted so strong a proof 

37 







Torture 


The spectacle of the scaffold 


that there was scarcely any need to add others, or to enter the diffi¬ 
cult and dubious combinatory of clues; the confession, provided it 
was obtained in the correct manner, almost discharged the prosecu¬ 
tion of the obligation to provide further evidence (in any case, the 
most difficult evidence). Secondly, the only way that this procedure 
might use all its unequivocal authority, and become a real victory 
over the accused, the only way in which the truth might exert all its 
power, w ( as for the criminal to accept responsibility for his own 
crime and himself sign what had been skilfully and obscurely 
constructed by the preliminary investigation. ‘It is not enough’, as 
Ayrault, w-ho did not care for these secret procedures, remarked, 
‘that wrong-doers be justly punished. They must if possible judge 
and condemn themselves’ (Ayrault, i. I, chapter 14). Within the 
crime reconstituted by writing, the criminal who confessed came to 
play the role of living truth. The confession, an act of the criminal, 
responsible and speaking subject, was the complement to the written, 
secret preliminary investigation. Hence the importance that all this 
procedure of an inquisitorial type accorded to the confession. 

IIem.c, iuu, rhe: ambiguities of its role. On the one hand, an 
attempt was made to introduce it into the general arithmetic of 
evidence; it was stressed that it was no more than one proof among 
many. It was not the evidentia rei; nor was it the strongest of the 
proofs, it was not in itself enough to bring conviction, it had to be 
accompanied by additional, circumstantial evidence; for it is a well- 
known fact that the accused sometimes declare themselves to be 
guilty of crimes that they have not committed; the examining magis¬ 
trate had therefore to carry out additional investigations if he 
possessed no more than the confession of the accused. But, on the 
other hand, the confession had priority over any other kind of 
evidence. To a certain extent, it transcended all other evidence; an 
element in the calculation of the truth, it was also the act by which 
the accused accepted the charge and recognized its truth; it trans¬ 
formed an investigation carried out without him into a voluntary 
affirmation. Through the confession, the accused himself took part 
in tile ritual of producing penal truth. As medieval law put it, the 
confession ‘renders the thing notorious and manifest’. To this first 
ambiguity was added a second: as a particularly strong proof, 
requiring for a conviction only a few additional clues, thus reducing 

38 


to the minimum the work of investigation and the mechanics of 
demonstration, the confession was therefore highly valued; every 
possible coercion -would be used to obtain it. But, although it had 
to be, in the procedure, the living and oral counterpart of the 
written preliminary investigation, although it had to be its reply, 
its authentication, as it were, on the part of the accused, it had to be 
surrounded by guarantees and formalities. It preserved something 
of a transaction: that is why it had to be ‘spontaneous’, why it had 
to be formulated before the competent court, why it had to be made 
in full consciousness, why it should not concern impossible things, 
etc. 2 Through the confession, the accused committed himself to the 
procedure; he signed the truth of the preliminary' investigation. 

This double ambiguity of the confession (an element of proof and 
the counterpart of preliminary investigation; the effect of constraint 
and a semi-voluntary transaction) explains the two great means used 
by classical criminal law to obtain it: the oath that the accused was 
asked to make before his interrogatory (and therefore under threat 
of perjury before both human and divine justice; and, at the same 
time, a ritual act of commitment); judicial torture (physical violence 
to obtain truth, which, in any case, had then to be repeated before 
the judges, as a ‘spontaneous’ confession, if it were to constitute 
proof). At the end of the eighteenth century, torture was to be 
denounced as a survival of the barbarities of another age: the mark 
of a savagery that was denounced as ‘Gothic’. It is true that the 
practice of torture is of ancient origin: it goes back at least as far 
as the Inquisition, of course, and probably to the torture of slaves. 
But it did not figure in classical law as a survival or defect. It occu¬ 
pied a strict place in a complex penal mechanism, in which the 
procedure of an inquisitorial type was reinforced with elements of 
the accusatory system; in which the written demonstration required 
an oral correlative; in which the techniques of proof administered 
by the magistrates were mingled with the methods of the ordeal to 
which the accused was challenged; in which he was called upon - if 
necessary by the most violent persuasion - to play the role of 
voluntary partner in the procedure; in which it w r as a question, in 
short, of producing truth by a mechanism consisting of tw'o ele¬ 
ments - that of the investigation carried out in secret by the judicial 
authority and that of the act ritually performed by the accused. The 

39 










Torture 


The spectacle of the scaffold 


body of the accused, the speaking and, if necessary, suffering body, 
assured the interlocking of these two mechanisms; that is why, 
until the classical system of punishment was re-examined from top 
to bottom, there were so few radical criticisms of torture (the most 
famous being Nicolas’s Si la torture est un moyen a verifier Us crimes 
of 1682). Much more frequent were simple recommendations of 
prudence: ‘Judicial torture is a dangerous means of arriving at 
knowledge of the truth; that is why judges must not resort to it with¬ 
out due consideration. Nothing is more equivocal. There are guilty 
men who have enough firmness to hide a true crime... and innocent 
victims who are made to confess crimes of which they were not 
guilty' (Ferriere, 612). 

On this basis one may see the functioning of judicial torture, or 
interrogation under torture, as a torture of the truth. To begin with, 
judicial torture was not a way of obtaining the truth at all costs; it 
was not the unrestrained torture of modern interrogations; it was 
certainly cruel, but it was not savage. It was a regulated practice, 
obeying a well-defined procedure; the various stages, their duration, 
the instruments used, the length of ropes and the heaviness of the 
weights used, the number of interventions made by the interrogating 
magistrate, all this was, according to the different local practices, 
carefully codified (In 1729, Aguesseau ordered an investigation into 
the means and rules of torture used in France. For a summary of the 
findings, cf. Joly de Fleurv, 322-8.) Torture was a strict judicial 
game. And, as such, it was linked to the old tests or trials - ordeals, 
judicial duels, judgements of God - that were practised in accusatory 
procedures long before the techniques of the Inquisition. Something 
of the joust survived, between the judge who ordered the judicial 
torture and the suspect who was tortured; the ‘patient’ - this is the 
term used to designate the victim - was subjected to a series of trials, 
graduated in severity, in which he succeeded if he ‘held out’, or 
failed if he confessed. (The first degree of torture was the sight of 
the instruments. In the case of children or of persons over the age 
of seventy, one did not go beyond this stage.) But the examining 
magistrate did not employ torture without himself taking certain 
risks (apart, that is, from the danger of causing the suspect’s death); 
he had a stake in the game, namely, the evidence that he had already 
collected; for the rule was that if the accused ‘held out’ and did not 


confess, the magistrate was forced to drop the charges. The tortured 
man had then won. Hence the custom, which had been introduced 
for the most serious cases, of imposing judicial torture ‘pending 
prooF: in this case the magistrate could continue with his investiga¬ 
tion after the torture had failed; the suspect was not declared 
innocent by his resistance; but at least his victory sived him from 
being condemned to death. The judge kept all his cards, except the 
principal one. Omnia citra mortem. Hence the recommendation 
often made to magistrates, in the case of the most serious crimes, 
not to subject to judicial torture a suspect against whom the evidence 
was sufficiently convincing for, if he managed to resist the torture, 
the magistrate would no longer have the right to pass the death 
sentence, which he nevertheless deserved; in such a joust, justice 
would be the loser: if the evidence was sufficient ‘to condemn such a 
guilty person to death’, one should not ‘leave the conviction to 
chance and to the outcome of a provisional interrogation that often 
leads to nothing; for it is in the interest of public safety to make 
examples of grave, horrible and capital crimes’ (Rousseaud de la 
Combe, 503). 

Beneath an apparently determined, impatient search for truth, 
one finds in classical torture the regulated mechanism of an ordeal: 
a physical challenge that must define the truth; if the patient is 
guilty, the pains that it imposes are not unjust; but it is also a mark 
of exculpation if he is innocent. In the practice of torture, pain, 
confrontation and truth were bound together: they worked to¬ 
gether on the patient’s body. The search for truth through judicial 
torture was certainly a way of obtaining evidence, the most serious 
of all - the confession of the guilty person; but it was also the battle, 
and this victory of one adversary over the other, that ‘produced’ 
truth according to a ritual. In torture employed to extract a con¬ 
fession, there was an element of the investigation; there also was an 
element of the duel. 

It is as if investigation and punishment had become mixed. And 
this is not the least paradoxical thing about it. Judicial torture was 
indeed defined as a way of complementing the demonstration when 
‘there are not sufficient penalties in the trial’. For it was included 
among the penalties; it was a penalty so grave that, in the hierarchy 
of punishments, the ordinance of 1760 placed it immediately after 










Torture

death. How can a penalty be used as a means? one was later to ask. 
How can one treat as a punishment what ought to be a method of 
demonstration? The reason is to be found in the way in which 
criminal justice, in the classical period, operated the production of 
truth. The different pieces of evidence did not constitute so many 
neutral elements, until such time as they could be gathered together 
into a single body of evidence that would bring the final certainty 
ol guilt. Each piece of evidence aroused a particular degree of 
abomination. Guilt did not begin when all the evidence was gathered 
together; piece by piece, it was constituted by each of the elements 
that made it possible to recognize a guilty person. Thus a semi¬ 
proof did not leave the suspect innocent until such time as it was 
completed; it made him semi-guilty; slight evidence of a serious 
crime marked someone as slightly criminal. In short, penal demon¬ 
stration did not obey a dualistic system: true or false; but a 
principle of continuous gradation; a degree reached in the demon¬ 
stration already formed a degree of guilt and consequently involved 
a degree of punishment. The suspect, as such, always deserved a 
certain punishment; one could not be the object of suspicion and be 
completely innocent. Suspicion implied an element of demonstration 
as regards the judge, the mark of a certain degree of guilt as regards 
the suspect and a limited form of penalty as regards punishment. A 
suspect, who remained a suspect, was not for all that declared inno¬ 
cent, but was partially punished. When one reached a certain degree 
ol presumption, one could then legitimately bring into play a 
practice that had a dual role: to begin the punishment in pursuance 
of the information already collected and to make use of this first 
stage of punishment in order to extort the truth that was still miss¬ 
ing. In the eighteenth century, judicial torture functioned in that 
strange economy in which the ritual that produced the truth went 
side by side with the ritual that imposed the punishment. The body 
interrogated in torture constituted the point of application of the 
punishment and the locus of extortion of the truth. And just as 
presumption was inseparably an element in the investigation and a 
fragment of guilt, the regulated pain involved in judicial torture 
was a means both of punishment and of investigation. 

Now, curiously enough, this interlocking of the two rituals 


through the body continued, evidence having been confirmed and 
sentence passed, in the actual carrying out of the penalty; and the 
body of the condemned man was once again an essential element in 
the ceremonial of public punishment. It was the task of the guilty 
man to bear openly his condemnation and the truth of the crime 
that he had committed. His body, displayed, exhibited in procession, 
tortured, served as the public support of a procedure that had 
hitherto remained in the shade; in him, on him, the sentence had to 
be legible for all. This immediate, striking manifestation of the 
truth in the public implementation of penalties assumed, in the 
eighteenth century, several aspects. 

i. It made the guilty man the herald of his own condemnation. 
He was given the task, in a sense, of proclaiming it and thus attesting 
to the truth of what he had been charged with: the procession 
through the streets, the placard attached to his back, chest or head 
as a reminder of the sentence; the halts at various crossroads, the 
reading of the sentence, the amende honorable performed at the doors 
of churches, in which the condemned man solemnly acknowledged 
his crime: 'Barefoot, wearing a shirt, carrying a torch, kneeling, to 
say and to declare that wickedly, horribly, treacherously, he has 
committed the most detestable crime, etc.'; exhibition at a stake 
where his deeds and the sentence were read out; yet another reading 
of the sentence at the foot of the scaffold; whether he was to go 
simply to the pillory or to the stake and the wheel, the condemned 
man published his crime and the justice that had been meted out to 
him by bearing them physically on his body. 

a. It took up once again the scene of the confession. It dupli¬ 
cated the forced proclamation of the amende honorable with a 
spontaneous, public acknowledgement. It established the public 
execution as the moment of truth. These last moments, when the 
guilty man no longer has anything to lose, arc won for the full light 
of truth. After the passing of the sentence, the court could decide 
on same new torture to obtain the names of possible accomplices. 
It was also recognized that at the very moment he mounted the 
scaffold the condemned man could ask for a respite in order to make 
new revelations. The public expected this new turn in the course of 
truth. Many made use of it in order to gain time, as did Michel 
Barbier, found guilty of armed assault: 'He stared impudently at the

scaffold and said that it had certainly not been set up for him, since 
he was innocent; he first asked to return to the chamber, where he 
beat about the bush for half an hour, still trying to justify himself; 
then, when he was sent back to execution, he ascended the scaffold 
with a purposeful air, but, when he saw himself undressed and tied 
to the cross before being stretched, he asked to go back to the 
chamber a second time and there made a full confession of his 
crimes and even declared that he was guilty of another murder’ 
(Hardy, IV, 80). The function of the public torture and execution 
was to reveal the truth; and in this respect it continued, in the public 
eye, the work of the judicial torture conducted in private. It added 
to the conviction the signature of the convicted man. A successful 
public execution justified justice, in that it published the truth of the 
crime in the very body of the man to be executed. An example of the 
good condemned man was Francois Billiard, a senior postal official, 
who murdered his wife in 1772. The executioner wanted to hide 
his face to spare him the insults of the crowd: ‘ “This punishment, 
which I have merited, has not been inflicted upon me," he said, "so 
that I should not be seen by the public. . He was still wearing 
mourning dress in honour of his wife. . . He was wearing new 
shoes, his hair had been recently curled and powdered, and he had a 
countenance so modest and so dignified that those present who 
found themselves observing him more closely said that he must be 
the most perfect Christian or the greatest of all hypocrites. The 
placard that he was wearing on his chest had gone askew, and it was 
noticed that he had straightened it himself, no doubt so that people 
could read it the more easily' (Hardy, I, 327). If each of the partici¬ 
pants played his role well, the penal ceremony had the effectiveness 
of a long public confession. 

3. It pinned the public torture on to the crime itself; it established 
from one to the other a series of decipherable relations. It was an 
exhibition of the corpse of the condemned man at the scene of his 
crime, or at one of the near-by crossroads. The execution was often 
carried out at the very place where the crime had been committed - 
as in the case of the student who, in 1723, had killed several persons 
and for whom the presidial court of Nantes decided to set up a 
scaffold in front of the inn where he had committed his murders 
(Nantes, F.F. 124; cf. Parfouru, XXV). There was the use of 

44 


'symbolic' torture in which the forms of the execution referred to 
the nature of the crime: the tongues of blasphemers were pierced, the 
impure were burnt, the right hand of murderers was cut off; some¬ 
times the condemned man was made to carry the instrument of his 
crime - thus Damiens was made to hold in his guilty right hand the 
famous dagger with which he had committed the crime, hand and 
dagger being smeared with sulphur and burnt together. As Vico 
remarked, this old jurisprudence was ‘an entire poetics’. 

There were even some cases of an almost theatrical reproduction 
of the crime in the execution of the guilty man - with the same 
instruments, the same gestures. Thus justice had the crime re¬ 
enacted before the eyes of all, publishing it in its truth and at the 
same time annulling it in the death of the guilty man. Even as late 
in the eighteenth century as 1772, one finds sentences like the follow¬ 
ing: a servant girl at Cambrai, having killed her mistress, was con¬ 
demned to be taken to the place of her execution in a cart 'used to 
collect rubbish at the crossroads'; there a gibbet was to be set up 
‘at the foot of which will be placed the same chair in which the said 
I jleu, her mistress, was sitting at the time of the murder; and having 

( seated the criminal there, the executioner of the High Court of 
Justice will cut off her right hand, throw it in her presence into the 
fire, and, immediately afterwards, will strike her four blows with 
the cleaver with which she murdered the said Laleu, the first and 
second being on the head, the third on the left forearm and the 
fourth on the chest; this done, she will be hung and strangled on the 
said gibbet until she be dead; and when two hours have elapsed her 
dead body will be removed and the head separated from it at the 
foot of the said gibbet on the said scaffold, with the same cleaver 

( she used to murder her mistress, and the same head exhibited 
on a pole twenty feet high outside the gates of the said Cambrai, 
within reach of the road that leads to Douai, and the rest of the body 
put in a sack, and buried near the said pole at a depth of ten feet’ 
(quoted in Dautricourt, 269-70). 

4. Lastly, the slowness of the process of torture and execution, 
its sudden dramatic moments, the cries and sufferings of the con¬ 
demned man serve as an ultimate proof at the end of the judicial 
ritual. Every death agony expresses a certain truth: but, when it 
takes place on the scaffold, it does so with more intensity, in that it 

45 


Torture 


is hastened by pain; with more rigour, because it occurs exactly at 
the juncture between the judgement of men and the judgement of 
God; with more ostentation, because it takes place in public. The 
sufferings of the condemned man are an extension of those of the 
judicial torture that precedes them; in the judicial torture, however, 
the game was not yet over and one could still save one’s life; now 
one will die, without any doubt, and it is one's soul that one must 
save. The eternal game has already begun: the torture of the execu¬ 
tion anticipates the punishments of the beyond; it shows what they 
are; it is the theatre of hell; the cries of the condemned man, his 
struggles, his blasphemies, already signify his irremediable destiny. 
But the pains here below may also be counted as penitence and so 
alleviate the punishments of the beyond: God will not fail to take 
such a martyrdom into account, providing it is borne with resigna¬ 
tion. The cruelty of the earthly punishment will be deducted from 
the punishment to come: in it is glimpsed the promise of forgive¬ 
ness. But, it might be said, arc not such terrible sufferings a sign 
that God has abandoned the guilty man to the mercy of his fellow 
creatures? And, far from securing future absolution, do they not 
prefigure imminent damnation; so that, if the condemned man dies 
quickly, without a prolonged agony, is it not proof that God wishes 
to protect him and to prevent him from falling into despair? There 
is, therefore, an ambiguity in this suffering that may signify equally 
well the truth of the crime or the error of the judges, the goodness 
or the evil of the criminal, the coincidence or the divergence between 
the judgement of men and that of God. Hence the insatiable curiosity 
that drove the spectators to the scaffold to witness the spectacle of 
sufferings truly endured; there one could decipher crime and inno¬ 
cence, the past and the future, the here below and the eternal. It was 
a moment of truth that all the spectators questioned: each word, each 
cry, the duration of the agony, the resisting body, the life that clung 
desperately to it, all this constituted a sign. There was the man who 
survived 'six hours on the wheel, and did not want the executioner, 
who consoled and heartened him no doubt as best he could, to leave 
him for a moment’; there was the man who died ‘with true Christian 
feeling, and who manifested the most sincere repentance’; the man 
who 'expired on the wheel an hour after being put there; it is said 
that the spectators of his torture were moved by the outward signs 


46 


The spectacle of the scaffold 


of religion and repentance that he gave’; the man who had shown 
the most marked signs of contrition throughout the journey to the 
scaffold, but who, when placed alive on the wheel, ‘did not cease 
to let forth the most horrible cries'; or again the woman who ‘had 
preserved her calm up to the moment when the sentence was read, 
bui whose wits then began to turn; she was quite mad by the time 
she was hanged’ (Hardy, I, 13; IV, 42; V, 134). 

We have come full circle: from the judicial torture to the execu¬ 
tion, the body has produced and reproduced the truth of the crime 
-or rather it constitutes the element which, through a whole set of 
rituals and trials, confesses that the crime took place, admits that the 
accused did indeed commit it, shows that he bore it inscribed in 
himself and on himself, supports the operation of punishment and 
manifests its effects in the most striking way. The body, several 
times tortured, provides the synthesis of the reality of the deeds and 
the truth of the investigation, of the documents of the case and the 
statements of the criminal, of the crime and the punishment. It is an 
essential element, therefore, in a penal liturgy, in which it must 
serve as the partner of a procedure ordered around the formidable 
rights of the sovereign, the prosecution and secrecy. 

The public execution is to be understood not only as a judicial, 
but also as a political ritual. It belongs, even in minor cases, to the 
ceremonies by which power is manifested. 

An offence, according to the law of the classical age, quite apart 
from the damage it may produce, apart even from the rule that it 
breaks, offends the rectitude of those who abide by the law: 'If one 
commits something that the law forbids, even if there is neither harm 
nor injury to the individual, it is an offence that demands reparation, 
because the right of the superior man is violated and because it 
offends the dignity of his character’ (Risi, 9). Besides its immediate 
victim, the crime attacks the sovereign: it attacks him personally, 
once the law represents the will of the sovereign; it attacks him 
physically, since the force of the law is the force of the prince. 
’For a law to be in force in this kingdom, it must necessarily have 
emanated directly from the sovereign, or at least been confirmed by 
the seal of his authority’ (Muyart de Vouglans, xxxiv). The inter¬ 
vention of the sovereign is not, therefore, an arbitration between 


47 


Torture 


The spectacle of the scaffold 


two adversaries; it is much more, even, than an action to enforce 
respect for the rights of the individual; it is a direct reply to the 
person who has offended him. There can be no doubt that ‘the 
exercise of the sovereign power in the punishment of crime is one 
of the essential parts of the administration of justice’ (Jousse, vii). 
Punishment, therefore, cannot be identified with or even measured 
by the redress of the injury; in punishment, there must always be a 
portion that belongs to the prince, and, even when it is combined 
with the redress laid down, it constitutes the most important clement 
in the penal liquidation of the crime. Now, this portion belonging 
to the prince is not in itself simple: on the one hand, it requires 
redress for the injury that has been done to his kingdom (as an 
element of disorder and as an example given to others, this con¬ 
siderable injury is out of all proportion to that which has been 
committed upon a private individual); but it also requires that the 
king take revenge for an affront to his very person. 

The right to punish, therefore, is an aspect of the sovereign’s 
right to make war on his enemies: to punish belongs to 'that 
absolute power of life and death which Roman law calls merum 
imperium , a right by virtue of which the prince sees that his law is 
respected by ordering the punishment of crime’ (Muyart de Vou- 
glans, xxxiv). But punishment is also a way of exacting retribution 
that is both personal and public, since the physico-political force 
of the sovereign is in a sense present in the law: ’One secs by the 
very definition of the law that it tends not only to prohibit, but also 
to avenge contempt for its authority by the punishment of those who 
violate its prohibitions’ (Muyart de Vouglans, xxxiv). In the execu¬ 
tion of the most ordinary penalty, in the most punctilious respect of 
legal forms, reign the active forces of revenge. 

The public execution, then, has a juridico-political function. It is 
a ceremonial by which a momentarily injured sovereignty is recon¬ 
stituted. It restores that sovereignty by manifesting it at its most 
spectacular. The public execution, however hasty and everyday, 
belongs to a whole scries of great rituals in which power is eclipsed 
and restored (coronation, entry of the king into a conquered city, 
the submission of rebellious subjects); over and above the crime 
that has placed the sovereign in contempt, it deploys before all eyes 
an invincible force. Its aim is not so much to re-establish a balance 

48 


as to bring into play, as its extreme point, the dissymmetry between 
the subject who has dared to violate the law and the all-powerful 
sovereign who displays his strength. Although redress of the private 
injury occasioned by the offence must be proportionate, although the 
sentence must be equitable, the punishment is carried out in such a 
way as to give a spectacle not of measure, but of imbalance and 
excess; in this liturgy of punishment, there must be an emphatic 
affirmation of power and of its intrinsic superiority. And this superi¬ 
ority is not simply that of right, but that of the physical strength 
of the sovereign beating down upon the body of his adversary and 
mastering it: by breaking the law, the offender has touched the very 
person of the prince; and it is the prince - or at least those to whom 
he has delegated his force - who seizes upon the body of the con¬ 
demned man and displays it marked, beaten, broken. The ceremony 
of punishment, then, is an exercise of ‘terror’. When the jurists of 
the eighteenth century began their polemic with the reformers, they 
offered a restrictive, ‘modernist' interpretation of the physical 
cruelty of the penalties imposed by the law: if severe penalties are 
required, it is because their example must be deeply inscribed in the 
hearts of men. Yet, in fact, what had hitherto maintained this 
practice of torture was not an economy of example, in the sense in 
which it was to be understood at the time of the idtologucs (that the 
representation of the penalty should be greater than the interest of 
the crime), but a policy of terror: to make everyone aware, through 
the body of the criminal, of the unrestrained presence of the sover¬ 
eign. The public execution did not re-establish justice; it reactivated 
power. In the seventeenth century, and even in the early eighteenth 
century, it was not, therefore, with all its theatre of terror, a linger¬ 
ing hang-over from an earlier age. Its ruthlessncss, its spectacle, its 
physical violence, its unbalanced play of forces, its meticulous 
ceremonial, its entire apparatus were inscribed in the political 
functioning of the penal system. 

This enables us to understand some of the characteristics of the 
liturgy of torture and execution - above all, the importance of a 
ritual that was to deploy its pomp in public. Nothing was to be 
hidden of this triumph of the law. Its episodes were traditionally the 
same and yet the sentences never failed to list them, so important 
were they in the penal mechanism: processions, halts at crossroads 

49

and church doors, the public reading of the sentence, kneeling, 
declarations of repentance for the offence to God and to the king. 
Sometimes questions of precedence and ceremonial were settled by 
the court itself: ‘The officers will ride according to the following 
order: namely, at the head two police sergeants; then the patient; 
after the patient, Bonfort and Le Corre on his left will walk together, 
followed by the clerk of the court and in this manner shall go to the 
market square at which place the judgement shall be carried out' 
(quoted in Corre, 7). Now, this meticulous ceremonial was not only 
legal, but quite explicitly military. The justice of the king was 
shown to be an armed justice. The sw’ord that punished the guilty’ 
was also the sword that destroyed enemies. A whole military machine 
surrounded the scaffold: cavalry of the watch, archers, guardsmen, 
soldiers. This was intended, of course, to prevent any escape or 
show of force; it was also to prevent any outburst of sympathy or 
anger on the part of the people, any attempt to save the condemned 
or to have them immediately put to death; but it was also a reminder 
that every crime constituted as it were a rebellion against the law 
and that the criminal was an enemy of the prince. All these reasons - 
whether a matter of precaution in particular circumstances or a 
functional element in the performance of the ritual - made the public 
execution more than an act of justice; it was a manifestation of 
force; or rather, it was justice as the physical, material and awesome 
force of the sovereign deployed there. The ceremony of the public 
torture and execution displayed for all to see the power relation 
that gave his force to the law. 

As a ritual of armed law, in which the prince showed himself, 
indissociably, both as head of justice and head of war, the public 
execution had two aspects: one of victory, the other of struggle. 
It brought to a solemn end a war, the outcome of which was 
decided in advance, between the criminal and the sovereign; it had 
to manifest the disproportion of power of the sovereign over those 
whom he had reduced to impotence. The dissymmetry, the irre¬ 
versible imbalance of forces were an essential element in the public 
execution. A body effaced, reduced to dust and thrown to the winds, 
a body destroyed piece by piece by the infinite power of the sover¬ 
eign constituted not only the ideal, but the real limit of punishment. 
Take the celebrated torture and execution of Massola, which took 

50 


place at Avignon and which was one of the first to arouse the 
indignation of contemporaries. This was an apparently paradoxical 
• rremony, since it took place almost entirely after death, and since 
justice did little more than deploy its magnificent theatre, the ritual 
praise of its force, on a corpse. The condemned man was blind¬ 
folded and tied to a stake; all around, on the scaffold, were stakes 
with iron hooks. ‘The confessor whispered in the patient’s car and, 
after he had given him the blessing, the executioner, who had an 
iron bludgeon of the kind used in slaughter houses, delivered a blow 
with all his might on the temple of the wretch, who fell dead: the 
mortis exactor , who had a large knife, then cut his throat, which 
spattered him with blood; it was a horrible sight to see; he severed 
the sinews near the two heels, and then opened up the belly from 
which he drew the heart, liver, spleen and lungs, which he stuck on 
an iron hook, and cut and dissected into pieces, which he then stuck 
on the other hooks as he cut them, as one docs with an animal. 
Look who can at such a sight' (Bruncau, 159). In the explicit 
reference to the butcher’s trade, the infinitesimal destruction of the 
l»ody is linked here with spectacle: each piece is placed on display. 

The execution was accompanied by a whole ceremonial of 
triumph; but it also included, as a dramatic nucleus in its monotonous 
progress, a scene of confrontation: this was the immediate, direct 
action of the executioner on the body of the 'patient'. It was a coded 
action, of course, since custom and, often quite explicitly, the sen¬ 
tence prescribed its principal episodes. Nevertheless, it did preserve 
uimething of the battle. The executioner not only implemented the 
law, he also deployed the force; he was the agent of a violence applied, 
in order to master it, to the violence of the crime. Materially, physic¬ 
ally, he was the adversary of this crime: an adversary who could show 
pity or ruthlessness. Damhoudcre complained, with many of his 
contemporaries, that the executioners exercised ‘every cruelty with 

I regard to the evil-doing patients, treating them, buffeting and killing 
them as if they had a beast in their hands' (Damhoudcre, 219). And 
for a long time the habit did not die out. 3 There was still an clement 
of challenge and of jousting in the ceremony of public execution. 
If the executioner triumphed, if he managed to cut off the head with 
a single blow, he ‘showed it to the people, put it down on the ground 
and then 'waved to the public who greatly applauded his skill by

clapping’. (A scene observed by T. S. Gueulctte, at the execution of 
Montigny in 1737 - cf. Anchel, 62-9.) Conversely, if he failed, if he 
did not succeed in killing the ‘patient’ as required, he was liable to 
punishment. This was the case of Damiens’s executioner who, being 
unable to quarter his patient according to the rules, had to cut him 
up with a knife; as a result, Damiens’s hair, which had been prom¬ 
ised to him, was confiscated and the money obtained from the sale 
given to the poor. Some years later, an executioner at Avignon 
caused excessive pain to three bandits, who were nevertheless 
formidable characters, whom he had to hang; the spectators became 
angry; they denounced him; in order to punish him and also to 
protect him from mob violence, he was put into prison (Duhamel, 
25). And, behind this punishment of the unskilful executioner, 
stands a tradition, which is still close to us, according to which the 
condemned man should be pardoned if the execution happened to 
fail. It was a custom clearly established in certain countries: in 
Burgundy, for instance (cf. Chassan^c, 55). The people often 
expected it to be applied, and would sometimes protect a condemned 
man who had escaped death in this way. In order to abolish both 
custom and expectation, they had to revive the adage, ‘the gibbet 
docs not lose its prey’, to introduce explicit instructions in capital 
sentences, such as ‘hanged by the neck until he be dead'. And jurists 
like Scrpillon or Blackstonc were insisting in the middle of the 
eighteenth century that a failure on the part of the executioner did 
not mean that the condemned man's life was spared (Scrpillon, III, 
1 too). In his Commentaries on the Laws of England , Blackstonc 
remarks: ‘It is clear, that if, upon judgement to be hanged by the 
neck till he is dead, the criminal be not thoroughly killed, but 
revives, the sheriff must hang him again. For the former hanging 
was no execution of the sentence; and, if a false tenderness were to 
be indulged in such cases, a multitude of collusions might ensue' 
(Blackstone, 199). There was something of the ordeal and something 
of God’s judgement that was still indecipherable in the ceremony of 
execution. In his confrontation with the condemned man, the execu¬ 
tioner was a little like the king’s champion. Yet he was an unacknow- 
ledgeable and unacknowledged champion: the tradition was, it seems, 
that when the executioner’s letters were sealed, they were not placed 
on the table, but thrown on the ground. The various prohibitions 


urrounding this ‘very necessary’ yet ‘unnatural’ office are well 
known (Loyseau, 80-81). The executioner may have been, in a 
vense, the king’s sword, but he shared the infamy of his adversary. 
The sovereign power that enjoined him to kill, and which through 
him did kill, was not present in him; it was not identified with his 
own ruthlessness. And it never appeared with more spectacular 
effect than when it interrupted the executioner’s gesture with a letter 
of pardon. The short time that usually elapsed between sentence 
and execution (often a few hours) meant that the pardon usually 
arrived at the very last moment. But the ceremony, by the very 
slowness of its progress, was no doubt arranged to leave room for 
this eventuality. (Cf. Hardy, 30 January 1769, 1 ,115 ant * M Decem¬ 
ber 1779, IV, 229; Anchel, 162-3, tells the story of Antoine Boulle- 
teix, who was already at the foot of the scaffold when a horseman 
arrived carrying the celebrated parchment. Shouts of 'God save the 
King’ arose and Boulleteix was taken to the tavern, while the clerk 
of the court made a collection on his behalf.) The condemned 
always hoped for a pardon and, in order to drag things out, they 
would pretend, even at the foot of the scaffold, that they had further 
revelations to make. When the people wanted a pardon they called 
for it aloud and tried to postpone the last moment, looking out for 
the arrival of the messenger bearing the letter with the green wax 
veal and if necessary claiming that he was on his way (this happened 
during the execution of those condemned for the uprising against 
child abduction on 3 August 1750). The sovereign was present at 
the execution not only as the power exacting the vengeance of the 
law, but as the power that could suspend both law and vengeance. 
He alone must remain master, he alone could wash away the offences 
committed on his person; although it is true that he delegated to the 
courts the task of exercising his power to dispense justice, he had 
not transferred it; he retained it in its entirety and he could suspend 
the sentence or increase it at will. 

We must regard the public execution, as it was still ritualized in 
the eighteenth century, as a political operation. It was logically 
inscribed in a system of punishment, in w hich the sovereign, directly 
or indirectly, demanded, decided and carried out punishments, in 
so far as it was he who, through the law, had been injured by the 
crime. In every offence there was a crimen majestatis and in the least

criminal a potential regicide. And the regicide, in turn, was neither 
more nor less, than the total, absolute criminal since, instead of 
attacking, like any offender, a particular decision or wish of the 
sovereign power, he attacked the very principle and physical person 
of the prince. The ideal punishment of the regicide had to constitute 
the summum of all possible tortures. It would be an expression of 
infinite vengeance: French law, in any case, made provisions for no 
fixed penalties for this sort of monstrosity. For the execution of 
Ravaillac the form of the ceremony had to be invented, by combin¬ 
ing all the cruellest tortures then practised in France. For Damiens, 
an attempt was made to think up still more atrocious tortures. 
Suggestions were made, but they were considered to be less perfect. 
So the form of Ravaillac’s execution was repeated. And it must be 
admitted that it was relatively modest if one thinks how in 1584 the 
assassin of William of Orange was abandoned to what seems like an 
infinity of vengeance. ‘On the first day, he was taken to the square 
where he found a cauldron of boiling water, in which was submerged 
the arm with which he had committed the crime. The next day the 
arm was cut off, and, since it fell at his feet, he was constantly 
kicking it up and down the scaffold; on the third day, red-hot 
pincers were applied to his breasts and the front of his arm; on the 
fourth day, the pincers were applied similarly on the back of his 
arm and on his buttocks; and thus, consecutively, this man was 
tortured for eighteen days.' On the last day, he was put to the wheel 
and 'maillott' [beaten with a wooden club]. After six hours, he was 
still asking for water, which was not given him. 'Finally the police 
magistrate was begged to put an end to him by strangling, so that 
his soul should not despair and be lost' (Brantomc, II, 191-2). 

There can be no doubt that the existence of public tortures and 
executions were connected with something quite other than this 
internal organization. Rusche and Kirchheimer are right to see it as 
the effect of a system of production in which labour power, and 
therefore the human body, has neither the utility nor the commercial 
value that are conferred on them in an economy of an industrial 
type. Moreover, this ‘contempt’ for the body is certainly related to 
a general attitude to death; and, in such an attitude, one can detect 
not only the values proper to Christianity, but a demographical, 

54 


in a sense biological, situation: the ravages of disease and hunger, 
the periodic massacres of the epidemics, the formidable child mor¬ 
tality rate, the precariousness of the bio-economic balances — all this 
made death familiar and gave rise to rituals intended to integrate it, 
to make it acceptable and to give a meaning to its permanent 
aggression. But in analysing why the public executions survived for 
so long, one must also refer to the historical conjuncture; it must 
not be forgotten that the ordinance of 1670 that regulated criminal 
justice almost up to the Revolution had even increased in certain 
respects the rigour of the old edicts; Pussort, who, among the com¬ 
missioners entrusted with the task of drawing up the documents, 
represented the intentions of the king, was responsible for this, 
despite the views of such magistrates as Lamoignon; the number of 
uprisings at the very height of the classical age, the rumbling close 
at hand of civil war, the king’s desire to assert his power at the 
expense of the parlements go a long way to explain the survival of 
so severe a penal system. 

In accounting for a penal system involving so much torture, these 
are general and in a sense external reasons; they explain not only 
the possibility and the long survival of physical punishments, but 
also the weakness and the rather sporadic nature of the opposition 
to them. Against this general background we must bring out their 
precise function. If torture was so strongly embedded in legal 
practice, it was because it revealed truth and showed the operation 
of power. It assured the articulation of the written on the oral, the 
secret on the public, the procedure of investigation on the operation 
of the confession; it made it possible to reproduce the crime on the 
visible body of the criminal; in the same horror, the crime had to 
be manifested and annulled. It also made the body of the condemned 
man the place where the vengeance of the sovereign was applied, 
the anchoring point for a manifestation of power, an opportunity 
of affirming the dissymmetry of forces. We shall sec later that the 
trutli-power relation remains at the heart of all mechanisms of 
punishment and that it is still to be found in contemporary penal 
practice - but in a quite different form and with very’ different effects. 
The Enlightenment was soon to condemn public torture and execu¬ 
tion as an ‘atrocity’ - a term that was often used to describe it, but 
without any critical intention, by jurists themselves. Perhaps the 

55 






Torture 


notion of‘atrocity’ is one of those that best designates the economy 
of the public execution in the old penal practice. To begin with, 
atrocity is a characteristic of some of the great crimes: it refers to the 
number of natural or positive, divine or human laws that they 
attack, to the scandalous openness or, on the contrary, to the secret 
cunning with which they have been committed, to the rank and 
status of those who are their authors and victims, to the disorder 
that they presuppose or bring with them, to the horror they 
arouse. In so far as it must bring the crime before everyone’s eyes, 
in all its severity, the punishment must take responsibility for this 
atrocity: it must bring it to light by confessions, statements, inscrip¬ 
tions that make it public; it must reproduce it in ceremonies that 
apply it to the body of the guilty person in the form of humiliation 
and pain. Atrocity is that part of the crime that the punishment 
turns back as torture in order to display it in the full light of day: 
it is a figure inherent in the mechanism that produces the visible 
truth of the crime at the very heart of the punishment itself. The 
public execution formed part of the procedure that established the 
reality of what one punished. Furthermore, the atrocity of a crime 
was also the violence of the challenge flung at the sovereign; it was 
that which would move him to make a reply whose function was to 
go further than this atrocity, to master it, to overcome it by an 
excess that annulled it. The atrocity that haunted the public execu¬ 
tion played, therefore, a double role: it was the principle of the 
communication between the crime and the punishment, it was also 
the exacerbation of the punishment in relation to the crime. It pro¬ 
vided the spectacle with both truth and power; it was the culmina¬ 
tion of the ritual of the investigation and the ceremony in which the 
sovereign triumphed. And it joined both together in the tortured 
body. The punitive practice of the nineteenth century was to strive 
to put as much distance as possible between the ’serene' search for 
truth and the violence that cannot be entirely effaced from punish¬ 
ment. It set out to mark the heterogeneity that separates the crime 
that is to be punished and the punishment imposed by the public 
power. Between truth and punishment, there should no longer be 
any other relation than one of legitimate consequence. The punish¬ 
ing power should not soil its hands with a crime greater than the 
one it wished to punish. It should remain innocent of the penalty

that it inflicts. 'Let us hasten to proscribe such tortures. They were 
wonhy only of the crowned monsters who governed the Romans’ 
(Pastoret, on the subject of the punishment of regicides, II, 61). But, 
according to the penal practice of the preceding period, the proxim¬ 
ity in the public execution of the sovereign and the crime, the mix¬ 
ture that was produced in it of 'demonstration' and punishment, 
were not the result of a barbarous confusion; what joined them 
together was the mechanism of atrocity and its necessary concatena¬ 
tions. The atrocity of the expiation organized the ritual destruction 
of infamy by omnipotence. 

The fact that the crime and the punishment were related and 
bound up in the form of atrocity was not the result of some ob¬ 
scurely accepted law of retaliation. It was the effect, in the rites of 
punishment, of a certain mechanism of power: of a power that not 
only did not hesitate to exert itself directly on bodies, but was 
exalted and strengthened by its visible manifestations; of a power 
that asserted itself as an armed power whose functions of maintain¬ 
ing order were not entirely unconnected with the functions of war; 
of a power that presented rules and obligations as personal bonds, a 
breach of which constituted an offence and called for vengeance; 
of a power for which disobedience was an act of hostility, the first 
sign of rebellion, which is not in principle different from civil war; 
of a power that had to demonstrate not why it enforced its laws, 
but who were its enemies, and what unleashing of force threatened 
them; of a power which, in the absence of continual supervision, 
sought a renewal of its effect in the spectacle of its individual mani¬ 
festations; of a power that was recharged in the ritual display of its 
reality as 'super-power'. 

Of all the reasons why punishment that was not in the least 
ashamed of being ‘atrocious’ was replaced by punishment that was 
to claim the honour of being 'humane' there is one that must be 
analysed at once, for it is internal to the public execution itself: at 
once an element of its functioning and the principle of its perpetual 
disorder. 

In the ceremonies of the public execution, the main character was 
the people, whose real and immediate presence was required for the 
performance. An execution that was known to be taking place, but 


57 


Torture 


The spectacle of the scaffold 


which did so in secret, would scarcely have had any meaning. The 
aim was to make an example, not only by making people aware that 
the slightest offence was likely to be punished, but by arousing 
feelings of terror by the spectacle of power letting its anger fall upon 
the guilty person: 'In criminal matters, the most difficult point is 
the imposition of the penalty: it is the aim and the end of the 
procedure, and its only fruit, by example and terror, when it is well 
applied to the guilty person' (Bruneau, unnumbered preface to the 
first part). 

But, in this scene of terror, the role of the people was an ambigu¬ 
ous one. People were summoned as spectators: they were assembled 
to observe public exhibitions and amtndes honorabler ,; pillories, 
gallows and scaffolds were erected in public squares or by the road¬ 
side; sometimes the corpses of the executed persons were displayed 
for several days near the scenes of their crimes. Not only must 
people know, they must see with their own eyes. Because they must 
be made to be afraid; but also because they must be the witnesses, 
the guarantors, of the punishment, and because they must to a 
certain extent take part in it. The right to be witnesses was one that 
they possessed and claimed; a hidden execution was a privileged 
execution, and in such cases it was often suspected that it had not 
taken place with all its customary severity. There were protests 
when at the last moment the victim was taken away out of sight. 
The senior postal official who had been put on public exhibition 
for killing his wife was later taken away from the crowd. 'He was 
put into a hired coach; it was thought that if he had not been well 
escorted, it would have been difficult to protect him from being 
ill-treated by the populace, who yelled and jeered at him' (Hardy, I, 
328). When the woman Lescombat was hanged, care was taken to 
hide her face; she had 'a kerchief over her neck and head, which 
made the public murmur and say that it was not Lescombat’ 
(Anchcl, 70-71). The people claimed the right to observe the execu¬ 
tion and to see who was being executed. The first time the guillotine 
was used the Chronique de Paris reported that people complained 
that they could not see anything and chanted, ‘Give us back our 
gallows’ (Lawrence, 71 ff). The people also had a right to take part. 
The condemned man, carried in procession, exhibited, humiliated, 
with the horror of his crime recalled in innumerable ways, was 

58 


offered to the insults, sometimes to the attacks of the spectators. 
The vengeance of the people was called upon to become an un¬ 
obtrusive pan of the vengeance of the sovereign. Not that it was 
in any way fundamental, or that the king had to express in his own 
way the people's revenge; it was rather that the people had to bring 
its assistance to the king when the king undertook ‘to be avenged 
on his enemies', especially when those enemies were to be found 
among the people. It was rather like a ‘scaffold service' that the 
people owed the king’s vengeance. This ‘service’ had been specified 
in the old ordinances; the edict of 1347 concerning blasphemers 
stipulated that they would be exhibited at the pillory ‘from the hour 
of prime, to that of their deaths. And mud and other refuse, though 
no stone or anything injurious, could be thrown at their faces. . . 
The second time, in case of relapse, it is our will that he be put in the 
pillory on a solemn market day, and that his upper lip be split so 
that the teeth appear.' No doubt, at the classical period, this form 
of participation in the torture was no more than tolerated and 
attempts were made to limit it: because of the barbarities that it gave 
rise to and the usurpation it involved of the power to punish. But it 
belonged too closely to the general economy of the public execution 
for it to be eliminated altogether. Even in the eighteenth century, 
there were scenes like the one that accompanied the execution of 
Montigny in 1737; as the executioner was carrying out the execu¬ 
tion, the local fish-wives walked in procession, holding aloft an 
effigy of the condemned man, and then cut off its head (Anchcl, 63). 
And very often, as they moved slowly in procession through it, 
criminals had to be 'protected' from the crowd - both as an example 
and as a target, a possible threat and a 'prey', promised but also 
forbidden. In calling on the crowd to manifest its power, the 
sovereign tolerated for a moment acts of violence, which he accepted 
as a sign of allegiance, but which were strictly limited by the sover¬ 
eign’s own privileges. 

Now it was on this point that the people, drawn to the spectacle 
intended to terrorize it, could express its rejection of the punitive 
power and sometimes revolt. Preventing an execution that was 
regarded as unjust, snatching a condemned man from the hands of 
the executioner, obtaining his pardon by force, possibly pursuing 
and assaulting the executioners, in any case abusing the judges and 

59 


Torture 


The spectacle of the scaffold 


causing an uproar against the sentence - all this formed part of the 
popular practices that invested, traversed and often overturned the 
ritual of the public execution. This often happened, of course, in the 
case of those condemned for rioting: there were the disturbances 
that followed a famous case of child abduction, when the crowd 
wanted to prevent the execution of three supposed rioters, who were 
to be hanged at the cemetery of Saint-Jean, 'because there were 
fewer entrances and processions to guard’; 4 the terrified executioner 
cut down one of the condemned men; the archers let fly their arrows. 
It occurred again after the com riots of 1775; and again in 1786, 
when the day-labourers marched on Versailles and set about freeing 
their arrested comrades. But apart from these cases, when the pro¬ 
cess of agitation had been triggered off previously and for reasons 
that did not concern some measure of penal justice, one finds many 
examples when the agitation was provoked directly by a verdict 
and an execution: small, but innumerable 'disturbances around the 
scaffold’. 

In their most elementary forms, these disturbances began with the 
shouts of encouragement, sometimes the cheering, that accompanied 
the condemned man to his execution. Throughout the long proces¬ 
sion, he was sustained by 'the compassion of the meek and tender¬ 
hearted, and with the applause, admiration and envy of all the bold 
and hardened’ (Fielding, 449). If the crowd gathered round the 
scaffold, it was not simply to witness the sufferings of the condemned 
man or to excite the anger of the executioner: it was also to hear an 
individual who had nothing more to lose curse the judges, the laws, 
the government and religion. The public execution allowed the 
luxury of these momentary saturnalia, when nothing remained to 
prohibit or to punish. Under the protection of imminent death, the 
criminal could say everything and the crowd cheered. 'If there were 
annals in which the last words of the tortured and executed were 
scrupulously recorded, and if one had the courage to read through 
them, even if one did no more than question the vile populace that 
gathers around the scaffolds out of cruel curiosity, one would be told 
that no one who had died on the wheel did not accuse heaven for the 
misery that brought him to the crime, reproach his judges for their 
barbarity, curse the minister of the altars who accompanies them 
and blaspheme against the God whose organ he is’ (Boucher 

60 


d’Argis, 128-9). In these executions, which ought to show only the 
terrorizing power of the prince, there was a whole aspect of the 
carnival, in which rules were inverted, authority mocked and 
criminals transformed into heroes. The shame was turned round; 
the courage, like the tears and the cries of the condemned, caused 
offence only to the law. Fielding notes with regret: 'To unite the 
ideas of death and shame is not so easy as may be imagined ... I 
will appeal to any man who hath seen an execution, or a procession 
to an execution; let him tell me. When he hath beheld a poor 
wretch, bound in a cart, just on the verge of eternity, all pale and 
trembling with his approaching fate, whether the idea of shame 
hath ever intruded on his mind? much less will the bold daring 
rogue, who glories in his present condition, inspire the beholder 
with any such sensation’ (Fielding, 450). For the people who are 
there and observe, there is always, even in the most extreme ven¬ 
geance of the sovereign a pretext for revenge. 

This was especially the case if the conviction was regarded as 
unjust - or if One saw a man of the people put to death, for a crime 
that would have merited, for someone better born or richer, a com¬ 
paratively light penalty. It would seem that certain practices of penal 
justice were no longer supported in the eighteenth century - and 
perhaps for longer - by the lower strata of the population. This 
would explain why executions could easily lead to the beginnings 
of social disturbances. Since the poorest - it was a magistrate who 
mide the observation (Dupaty, 1786, 247) - could not be heard in 
the courts of law, it was where the law was manifested publicly, 
where they were called upon to act as witnesses and almost as co¬ 
adjutors of this law, that they could intervene, physically: enter by 
force into the punitive mechanism and redistribute its effects; take 
up in another sense the violence of the punitive rituals. There was 
agitation against the difference in penalties according to social class: 
in 1781, the parish priest of Champre had been killed by the lord 
of the manor, and an attempt was made to declare the murderer 
insane; 'the peasants, who were extremely attached to their pastor, 
were furious and had at first seemed ready to lay violent hands upon 
their lord and to set fire to the castle. . . Everyone protested, and 
rightly, against the indulgence of the minister who deprived justice 
of the means of punishing so abominable a crime’ (Hardy, IV, 394). 

61

The spectacle of the scaffold 


There was agitation, too, against the excessive sentences passed on 
certain common offences that were not regarded as serious (such as 
house-breaking); or against punishments for certain offences con¬ 
nected with social conditions such as petty larceny; the death penalty 
for this crime aroused a great deal of discontent, because there were 
many domestic servants in a single household and it was difficult 
for them, in such a case, to prove their innocence, and also because 
they could easily be victims of their employers' spite and because 
the indulgence of certain masters who shut their eyes to such 
behaviour made the fate of servants accused, condemned and hanged 
even more iniquitous. The execution of such servants often gave 
rise to protests (cf. Hardy, I, 319, 367; III, 227-8; IV, 180). There 
was a small riot in Paris in 1761 in favour of a servant woman who 
had stolen a piece of cloth from her master. Despite the fact that the 
woman admitted her guilt, handed back the material and begged for 
mercy, the master refused to withdraw his complaint; on the day 
of the execution, the local people prevented the hanging, invaded the 
merchant’s shop and looted it; in the end, the servant was pardoned, 
but a woman, who attempted, unsuccessfully, to stick a needle into 
the wicked master, was banished for three years (Anchel, 226). 

One remembers the great legal affairs of the eighteenth century, 
when enlightened opinion intervened in the persons of the philoso¬ 
phy and certain magistrates: Calas, Sirven and the Chevalier de La 
Barre, for instance. But less attention is given to the popular agita¬ 
tions caused by punitive practice. Indeed, they seldom spread be¬ 
yond a town, or even a district. Yet they did have a real importance. 
Sometimes these movements, which originated from below, spread 
and attracted the attention of more highly placed persons who, 
taking them up, gave them a new dimension (in the years preceding 
the Revolution, the affair of Catherine Espinas, falsely convicted of 
parricide in 1785, or the case of the three men of Chaumont, con¬ 
demned to the wheel, for whom Dupaty, in 1786, wrote his cele¬ 
brated memoir, or that of Marie Fran^oise Salmon, whom the 
parlement of Rouen in 1782 had condemned to the stake, for poison¬ 
ing, but who in 1786 had still not been executed). More usually, 
those disturbances had maintained around penal justice and its 
manifestations, which ought to have been exemplary, a state of 
permanent unrest. How often had it proved necessary, in order to 

62 


ensure order around the scaffolds, to take steps that w r ere ‘distressing 
to the people’ and ‘humiliating for the authorities’ (Argenson, 241)? 
It was evident that the great spectacle of punishment ran the risk 
of being rejected by the very people to whom it was addressed. In 
fact, the terror of the public execution created centres of illegality: 
on execution days, work stopped, the taverns were full, the authori¬ 
ties were abused, insults or stones were thrown at the executioner, 
the guards and the soldiers; attempts were made to seire the con¬ 
demned man, either to save him or to kill him more surely; fights 
broke out, and there w'as no better prey for thieves than the curious 
throng around the scaffold. (Hardy recounts a number of cases like 
the important theft that was committed in the very house in which 
the police magistrate was lodging - IV, j6.) But above all - and this 
was why these disadvantages became a political danger - the people 
never felt closer to those who paid the penalty than in those rituals 
intended to show the horror of the crime and the invincibility of 
power; never did the people feel more threatened, like them, by a 
legal violence exercised without moderation or restraint. The solid¬ 
arity of a whole section of the population w'ith those we would call 
petty offenders - vagrants, false beggars, the indigent poor, pick- 

I pockets, receivers and dealers in stolen goods - was constantly 
expressed: resistance to police searches, the pursuit of informers, 
attacks on the watch or inspectors provide abundant evidence of 
this (cf. Richer, 118-19). And it was the breaking up of this solidar¬ 
ity that was becoming the aim of penal and police repression. Yet 
out of the ceremony of the public execution, out of that uncertain 
festival in which violence was instantaneously reversible, it was this 
solidarity much more than the sovereign power that was likely to 
emerge with redoubled strength. The reformers of the eighteenth 

( and nineteenth centuries were not to forget that, in the last resort, 
the executions did not, in fact, frighten the people. One of their 
first cries was to demand their abolition. 

To clarify the political problem posed by the intervention of the 
people in the spectacle of the executions, one need only cite two 
events. The first took place at Avignon at the end of the seventeenth 
century’. It contained all the principal elements of the theatre of 
horror the physical confrontation between the executioner and the 
condemned man, the reversal of the duel, the executioner pursued 

6 3

The spectacle of the scaffold 


by the people, the condemned man saved by the ensuing riot and 
the violent inversion of the penal machinery. A murderer by the 
name of Pierre du Fort was to be hanged; several times he ‘had 
caught his feet in the steps' and had not been able to swing freely. 
‘Seeing this, the executioner had pulled his jerkin up over his face 
and struck him below the knees, on the stomach and on the belly. 
When the people saw that the executioner was causing him too 
much pain, and even believing that he was killing him down there 
with a bayonet ... moved by compassion for the patient and fury 
at the executioner, they threw stones at the scaffold just as the 
executioner knocked away the two ladders and threw the patient 
down and leaped on to his shoulders and kicked him, while the wife 
of the said executioner pulled at his feet from under the gallows. 
In doing so, they made blood come from his mouth. But the hail 
of stones came thicker - one stone even struck the hanged man on 
the head - which forced the executioner to dash to the ladder, which 
he descended so rapidly that half-way down he fell from it, and 
struck his head on the ground. Then a crowd of people fell upon 
him. He got to his feet, bayonet in hand, threatening to kill anyone 
who came near him; after falling several times, he finally got to his 
feet, only to be beaten by the crowd, rolled in the mud and nearly 
drowned in the stream, then dragged by the excited and enraged 
crowd to the University and to the Cordeliers Cemetery. His 
servant was also beaten and, with bruises on his head and body, was 
taken to the hospital where he died some days later. However, some 
strangers and unknown people mounted the ladder and cut the rope 
while others caught the hanged man from below after he had been 
hanging there longer than it took to say a full Miserere. The crowd 
then smashed the gallows and broke the executioner’s ladder into 
pieces. . . Children carried off the gallows and threw it into the 
Rhone.’ The condemned man was then taken to a cemetery ‘so that 
he should not be recaptured by the law and from there to the church 
of Sainte-Antoine’. The archbishop gave him his pardon, had him 
taken to the hospital and asked that particular care be taken of him. 
Lastly, adds the writer of the account, 'we had a new suit, two pairs 
of stockings and shoes made for him. We dressed him in new 
clothes from head to toe. Our colleagues gave him shirts, breeches 
and a wig’ (Duhamel, 5 - 6 ; scenes of this kind were still taking 


place in the nineteenth century - cf. Lawrence, 56 and 195-8). 

The other event took place in Paris, a century later. It was in 1775. 
shortly after the com riot. Because of the state of extreme tension 
among the people, the authorities wanted the execution to take 
place without interruption. Between the scaffold and the public, 
kept at a safe distance, two ranks of soldiers stood on guard, one 
facing the execution that was about to take place, the other facing 
the people in case of riot. Contact was broken: it was a public 
execution, but one in which the element of spectacle was neutralized, 
or rather reduced to abstract intimidation. Protected by force of 
arms, on an empty square, justice quietly did its work. If it showed 
the death that it had dealt, it was from high and far: 'The two 
gallows, which were eighteen feet high, no doubt by way of an 
example, were not set up until three o’clock in the afternoon. From 
two o'clock, the Place de Gr£ve and all the surrounding streets had 
been filled with detachments of different troops, some on foot, some 
on horse; the Swiss and the French guards continued to patrol the 
adjacent streets. No one was allowed on to the Grivc during the 
execution, and all around one could see a double row of soldiers, 
bayonets at the ready, standing back to back, so that some looked 
outwards and some into the square; the two wretches ... cried out 
all the way that they were innocent and continued to protest in like 
manner as they mounted the ladder’ (Hardy, III, 67). Whatever the 
part played by feelings of humanity for the condemned in the 
abandonment of the liturgy of the public executions, there was, in 
any case, on the part of the state power, a political fear of the effects 
of these ambiguous rituals. 


Such an equivocal attitude appeared clearly in what might be 
called the ‘gallows speeches'. The rite of execution was so arranged 
that the condemned man would himself proclaim his guilt by the 
amende honorable that he spoke, by the placard that he displayed 
and also by the statements that he was no doubt forced to make. 
Furthermore, at the moment of the execution, it seems that he was 
given another opportunity to speak, not to proclaim his innocence, 
but to acknowledge his crime and the justice of his conviction. The 
chronicles relate a good many speeches of this kind. Were they 
actually delivered? In a number of cases, certainly. Or were they

fictional speeches that were later circulated by way of example and 
exhortation? This, no doubt, was more often the case. What credit 
are we to accord, for example, to the account of the death of Marion 
Le Goff, who had been a famous bandit leader in Brittany in the 
mid-eighteenth century? She is supposed to have cried out from the 
scaffold: 'Fathers and mothers who hear me now, watch over your 
children and teach them well; in my childhood I was a liar and good- 
for-nothing; I began by stealing a small six-liard knife. . . Then I 
robbed pedlars and cattle dealers; finally, I led a robber band and 
that is why I am here. Tell all this to your children and let it be an 
example to them' (Corre, 257). Such a speech is too close, even in its 
turn of phrase, to the morality traditionally to be found in the 
broadsheets and pamphlets for it not to be apocryphal. But the 
existence of the 'last words of a condemned man' genre is in itself 
significant. The law required that its victim should authenticate in 
some sense the tortures that he had undergone. The criminal was 
asked to consecrate his own punishment by proclaiming the black¬ 
ness of his crimes; he was made to say, as was Jean-Dominique 
Langlade, three times a murderer: 'Listen to my horrible, infamous 
and lamentable deed, committed in the city of Avignon, where the 
memory of me is execrable, for having inhumanly violated the 
sacred rites of friendship' (Duhamel, 31). In one sense, the broad¬ 
sheet and the death song were the sequel to the trial; or rather they 
pursued that mechanism by which the public execution transferred 
the secret, written truth of the procedure to the body, gesture and 
speech of the criminal. Justice required these apocrypha in order to 
be grounded in truth. Its decisions were thus surrounded by all 
these posthumous 'proofs’. Sometimes, too, accounts of crimes and 
infamous lives were published, simply as propaganda, before any 
trial had taken place, in order to force the hand of a court that was 
suspected of being too tolerant. In order to discredit smugglers, the 
Compagnie des Fermcs published 'bulletins' recounting their 
crimes: in 1768, it distributed broadsheets against a certain Mon- 
tagne, the leader of a gang, of whom the writer himself says: ‘Some 
thefts have been ascribed to him the truth of which is somewhat 
uncertain ...; Montagne has been depicted as a wild beast, a second 
hyena to be hunted down; given the hotheads of the Auvergne, this 
idea has caught on' (cf. Juillard, 24). 


But the effect, like the use, of this literature was equivocal. The 
condemned man found himself transformed into a hero by the sheer 
extent of his widely advertised crimes, and sometimes the affirmation 
of his belated repentance. Against the law, against the rich, the 
powerful, the magistrates, the constabulary or the watch, against 
taxes and their collectors, he appeared to have waged a struggle 
with which one all too easily identified. The proclamation of these 
crimes blew up to epic proportions the tiny struggle that passed 
unperceived in everyday life. If the condemned man was shown to 
be repentant, accepting the verdict, asking both God and man for 
forgiveness for his crimes, it was as if he had come through some 
process of purification: he died, in his own way, like a saint. But 
indomitability was an alternative claim to greatness: by not giving 
in under torture, he gave proof of a strength that no power had 
succeeded in bending: ‘On the day of the execution - this will seem 
scarcely credible -1 showed no trace of emotion, as I performed my 
amend* honorable , and when I finally lay down on the cross I showed 
no fear’ (the Complainte of J.-D. Langlade, executed at Avignon 
12 April 1768). Black hero or reconciled criminal, defender of the 
true right or an indomitable force, the criminal of the broadsheets, 
pamphlets, almanacs and adventure stories brought with him, be¬ 
neath the apparent morality of the example not to be followed, a 
whole memory of struggles and confrontations. A convicted criminal 
could become after his death a sort of saint, his memory honoured 
and his grave respected. (This was the case of Tanguy, executed in 
Brittany about 1740. Before being convicted, it is true, he had begun 
a long penitence ordered by his confessor. Was this a conflict 
between civil justice and religious penitence? Cf. Corre, 21.) The 
criminal has been almost entirely transformed into a positive hero. 
There were those for whom glory and abomination were not dis¬ 
sociated, but coexisted in a reversible figure. Perhaps we should sec 
this literature of crime, which proliferated around a few exemplary 
figures, 1 neither as a spontaneous form of 'popular expression’, nor 
as a concerted programme of propaganda and moralization from 
above; it was a locus in which two investments of penal practice 
met - a sort of battleground around the crime, its punishment and 
its memory. If these accounts were allowed to be printed and circu¬ 
lated, it was because they were expected to have the effect of an 




Torture 


ideological control - the printing and the distribution of these 
almanacs, broadsheets, etc. was in principle subject to strict control. 
But if these true stories of everyday history were received so avidly, 
if they formed part of the basic reading of the lower classes, it was 
because people found in them not only memories, but also prece¬ 
dents; the interest of'curiosity' is also a political interest. Thus these 
texts may be read as two-sided discourses, in the facts that they 
relate, in the effects they give to these facts and in the glory they 
confer on those ‘illustrious’ criminals, and no doubt in the very 
words they use (one should study the use of such categories as 
‘misfortune’ or 'abomination' or such epithets as ‘famous’ or 
‘lamentable’ in accounts such as The History of the Life, Great 
Robberies and Tricks of Guilleri and his Companions and of their 
Lamentable and Unhappy End.* 

Perhaps we should compare this literature with the 'disturbances 
around the scaffold’ in which, through the tortured body of the 
criminal, the power that condemned confronted the people that was 
the witness, the participant, the possible and indirect victim of this 
execution. In the wake of a ceremony that inadequately channelled 
the power relations it sought to ritualize, a whole mass of discourses 
appeared pursuing the same confrontation; the posthumous pro¬ 
clamation of the crimes justified justice, but also glorified the cri¬ 
minal. That was why the reformers of the penal system were soon 
demanding suppression of these broadsheets . 7 That was why the 
people showed so lively an interest in what served more or less as 
the minor, everyday epic of illegalities. That was why the broad¬ 
sheets lost their importance as the political function of popular 
illegality altered. 

And they disappeared as a whole new literature of crime deve¬ 
loped: a literature in which crime is glorified, because it is one of the 
fine arts, because it can be the work only of exceptional natures, 
because it reveals the monstrousness of the strong and powerful, 
because villainy is yet another mode of privilege: from the adventure 
story to de Quincey, or from the Castle of Otranto to Baudelaire, 
there is a whole aesthetic rewriting of crime, which is also the 
appropriation of criminality in acceptable forms. In appearance, it is 
the discovery of the beauty and greatness of crime; in fact, it is the 
affirmation that greatness too has a right to crime and that it even 


The spectacle of the scaffold 


becomes the exclusive privilege of those who are really great. The 
great murders are not for the pedlars of petty crime. While, from 
Gaboriau onwards, the literature of crime follows this first shift: by 
his cunning, his tricks, his sharp-wittedness, the criminal represented 
in this literature has made himself impervious to suspicion; and the 
struggle between two pure minds - the murderer and the detective - 
will constitute the essential form of the confrontation. We are far 
removed indeed from those accounts of the life and misdeeds of the 
criminal in which he admitted his crimes, and which recounted in 
detail the tortures of his execution: we have moved from the 
exposition of the facts or the confession to the slow process of 
discovery; from the execution to the investigation; from the phy¬ 
sical confrontation to the intellectual struggle between criminal and 
investigator. It was not only the broadsheets that disappeared with 
the birth of a literature of crime; the glory of the rustic malefactor 
and his sombre transformation into a hero by the process of torture 
and execution went with them. The man of the people was now 
too simple to be the protagonist of subtle truths. In this new genre, 
there were no more popular heroes or great executions; the criminal 
was wicked, of course, but he was also intelligent; and although he 
was punished, he did not have to suffer. The literature of crime 
transposes to another social class the spectacle that had surrounded 
the criminal. Meanwhile the newspapers took over the task of 
recounting the grey, unheroic details of everyday crime and punish¬ 
ment. The split was complete; the people was robbed of its old 
pride in its crimes; the great murders had become the quiet game of 
the well behaved. 



PART TWO 
Punishment 


I. 


Generalized punishment 


‘Lei penalties be regulated and proportioned to the offences, let the 
death sentence be passed only on those convicted of murder, and 
let the tortures that revolt humanity be abolished.’ Thus, in 1789, 
the chancellery summed up the general position of the petitions 
addressed to the authorities concerning tortures and executions (cf. 
Seligman, and Desjardin, 13-20). Protests against the public execu¬ 
tions proliferated in the second half of the eighteenth century: among 
the philosophers and theoreticians of the law; among lawyers and 
parlemeruaires; in popular petitions and among the legislators of the 
assemblies. Another form of punishment was needed: the physical 
confrontation between the sovereign and the condemned man must 
end ; this hand-to-hand fight between the vengeance of the prince and 
the contained anger of the people, through the mediation of the victim 
and the executioner, must be concluded. Very soon the public execu¬ 
tion became intolerable. On the side of power, where it betrayed 
tyranny, excess, the thirst for revenge, and ‘the cruel pleasure taken 
in punishing’ (Petion de Villeneuve, 641), it was revolting. On the 
side of the victim who, though reduced to despair, was still expected 
to bless ‘heaven and its judges who appeared to have abandoned 
him’ (Boucher d’Argis, 1781, 125), it was shameful. It was, in any 
case, dangerous, in that it provided a support for a confrontation 
l>etween the violence of the king and the violence of the people. It 
was as if the sovereign power did not see, in this emulation of 
atrocity, a challenge that it itself threw down and which might one 
day be taken up: accustomed as it was to 'seeing blood flow’, the 
people soon learnt that ‘it could be revenged only with blood’ 
(La:h£re). In these ceremonies, which were the object of so much 
adverse investment, one sees the intersection of the excess of armed 
justice and the anger of the threatened people. Joseph dc Maistre 




Punishment 


Generalized punishment 


was to recognize in this relation one of the fundamental mechanisms 
of absolute power: the executioner acts as a cog between the prince 
and the people; the death he deals is like that of the serfs who built 
St Petersburg over swamp and pestilence: it is a principle of uni¬ 
versality; of the individual will of the despot, it makes a law for all, 
and of each of those destroyed bodies, a stone for the State; it hardly 
matters that innocents, too, are struck down! In this same dangerous 
and ritual violence, the eighteenth-century reformers denounced, on 
the contrary, that which exceeded, on both sides, the legitimate 
exercise of power: in this violence, according to them, tyranny 
confronts rebellion; each calls forth the other. It is a double danger. 
Instead of taking revenge, criminal justice should simply punish. 

This need for punishment without torture was first formulated 
as a cry from the heart or from an outraged nature. In the worst of 
murderers, there is one thing, at least, to be respected when one 
punishes: his 'humanity'. The day was to come, in the nineteenth 
century, when this 'man', discovered in the criminal, would become 
the target of penal intervention, the object that it claimed to correct 
and transform, the domain of a whole scries of 'criminological' 
sciences and strange 'penitentiary’ practices. But, at the time of the 
Enlightenment, it was not as a theme of positive knowledge that 
man was opposed to the barbarity of the public executions, but as a 
legal limit: the legitimate frontier of the power to punish. Not that 
which must be reached in order to alter him, but that which must 
be left intact in order to respect him. Noli me tangere. It marks the 
end of the sovereign's vengeance. The ‘man’ that the reformers set 
up against the despotism of the scaffold has also become a 'man- 
measure’: not of things, but of power. 

There is, therefore, a problem here: how was this man-measure 
opposed to the traditional practice of punishment? How did he 
become the great moral justification of the reform movement? Why 
this universal horror of torture and such lyrical insistence that 
punishment be 'humane'? Or, which amounts to the same thing, 
how are the two elements, which arc everywhere present in demands 
for a more lenient penal system, 'measure' and 'humanity', to be 
articulated upon one another, in a single strategy? These elements 
are so necessary and yet so uncertain that it is they, as disturbing as 
ever and still associated in the same dubious relation, that one finds 


today whenever the problem of an economy of punishment is posed. 
It is as if the eighteenth century had opened up the crisis of this 
economy and, in order to resolve it, proposed the fundamental law 
that punishment must have 'humanity' as its 'measure', without any 
definitive meaning being given to this principle, which nevertheless 
is regarded as insuperable. We must, therefore, recount the birth 
and early days of this enigmatic 'leniency'. 

Homage is paid to the ‘great reformers’ - Beccaria, Servan, 
Dupaty, Lacretelle, Duport, Pastoret, Target, Bcrgasse, the com¬ 
pilers of the Colliers, or petitions, and the Constituent Assembly - 
for having imposed this leniency on a legal machinery and on 
'classical' theoreticians who, at the end of the eighteenth century, 
were still rejecting it with well-formulated arguments. (Cf., in par¬ 
ticular, Muyart dc Vouglans’s polemic against Beccaria - Muyart, 
1766.) 

Yet this reform must be situated in a process that historians have 

I recently uncovered through the study of legal archives: the relaxa¬ 
tion of penality in the eighteenth century or, to be more precise, 
the double movement by which, during this period, crimes seemed 
to lose their violence, while punishments, reciprocally, lost some of 
their intensity, but at the cost of greater intervention. From the end 
of the seventeenth century, in fact, one observes a considerable 
diminution in murders and, generally speaking, in physical acts of 
aggression; offences against property seem to take over from crimes 
of violence; theft and swindling, from murder and assault; the 
diffuse, occasional, but frequent delinquency of the poorest classes 
was superseded by a limited, but 'skilled' delinquency; the criminals 
of the seventeenth century were 'harassed men, ill-fed, quick to act, 
quick to anger, seasonal criminals'; those of the eighteenth, 'crafty, 
cunning, sly, calculating'criminals on the fringes of society (Chaunu, 
1961, Z36 and 1966, 107-8). Lastly, the internal organizations of 
delinquency altered; the great gangs of malefactors (looters working 
in small, armed units, groups of smugglers firing on the agents of the 
tax authorities, disbanded soldiers or deserters who roamed the 
countryside together) tended to break up; tracked down more 
efficiently and forced to work in smaller groups - often no more 
than half-a-dozen men - in order to pass undetected, they contented

themselves with more furtive operations, with a more modest 
deployment of forces and less risk of bloodshed: 'The physical 
destruction or institutional dislocation of large gangs ... left the 
field free for an anti-property form of delinquency practised by 
individuals or very small groups of robbers and pickpockets, seldom 
more than four in number' (Le Roy-Ladurie). A general movement 
shifted criminality from the attack of bodies to the more or less 
direct seizure of goods; and from a ‘mass criminality’ to a 'marginal 
criminality’, partly the preserve of professionals. It was as if there 
had been a gradual lowering of level - 'a defusion of the tensions 
that dominate human relations, ... a better control of violent 
impulses' 1 - and as if the illegal practices had themselves slackened 
their hold on the body and turned to other targets. Crime became 
less violent long before punishment became less severe. But this 
transformation cannot be separated from several underlying pro¬ 
cesses. The first of these, as P. Chaunu observes, was a change in 
the operation of economic pressures, a general rise in the standard 
of living, a large demographic expansion, an increase in wealth and 
property and 'a consequent need for security' (Chaunu, 1971, 56). 
Furthermore, throughout the eighteenth century, one can observe a 
certain increased severity in the law: in England, out of the 223 
capital crimes in force at the beginning of the nineteenth century, 
156 had been introduced during the preceding hundred years 
(Buxton, XXXIX); in France, the legislation on vagabondage had 
been revised in the direction of greater severity on several occasions 
since the seventeenth century; a tighter, more meticulous implemen¬ 
tation of the law tended to take account of a mass of minor offences 
that it once allowed to escape more easily: 'in the eighteenth century, 
the law became slower, heavier, harder on theft, whose relative 
frequency had increased, and towards which it now assumed the 
bourgeois appearances of a class justice’;* the growth in France 
above all, and especially in Paris, of a police apparatus that prevented 
the development of organized, open criminality, shifted it towards 
more discreet forms; to this set of precautions, one should add the 
very widespread belief in a constant and dangerous rise in crime. 
Whereas the historians of today observe a diminution in the great 
gangs of malefactors, Le Trosne saw them roaming the French 
countryside like swarms of locusts: 'It is these voracious insects who 

76 


daily lay waste the subsistence of the cultivators. They are, quite 
literally, enemy troops spreading over the surface of the territory, 
living as they wish, as in a conquered country, exacting levies under 
the name of alms.' They cost the poorest peasants more than taxes: 
the richer peasants had to pay anything up to a third of their 
incomes (Le Trosne, 1764, 4). Most observers maintained that crime 
was increasing - they included, of course, those who advocated 
sterner measures; they also included those who thought that a law 
that was more restrained in its use of violence would be more 
effective, less liable to retreat before its own consequences (cf., for 
example, Dupaty, 247); and they included the magistrates who 
claimed to be swamped by the number of trials: 'the misery of the 
people and the corruption of morals have increased the number of 
crimes and convicted criminals' (one of the judges of the Chambre 
de la Toumelle in an address to the king, 2 August 1768, quoted 
in Farge, 66); in any case, that crime was on the increase was shown 
by the real practice of the courts. ‘The revolutionary and imperial 
era could already be sensed in the last years of the Ancicn Regime. 
One is struck, in the trials of 1782-9, by the increase in tension. 
There is a new severity towards the poor, a concerted rejection of 

( evidence, a rise in mutual mistrust, hatred and fear' (Chaunu, 19 66, 

to8). 

In fact, the shift from a criminality of blood to a criminality of 
fraud forms part of a whole complex mechanism, embracing the 
development of production, the increase of wealth, a higher juridical 
and moral value placed on property relations, stricter methods of 
surveillance, a tighter partitioning of the population, more efficient 
techniques of locating and obtaining information: the shift in illegal 
practices is correlative with an extension and a refinement of puni¬ 
tive practices. 

Was this a general change of attitude, a 'change that belongs to 
the domain of the spirit and the subconscious' (the expression is 
Mogensen's)? Perhaps, but more certainly and more immediatcl) 
it was an effort to adjust the mechanisms of power that frame tht 
everyday lives of individuals; an adaptation and a refinement of tht 
machinery that assumes responsibility for and places under surveil¬ 
lance their everyday behaviour, their identity, their activity, their 
apparently unimportant gestures; another policy for that multiplicity

of bodies and forces that constitutes a population. What was emerg¬ 
ing no doubt was not so much a new respect for the humanity of 
the condemned - torture was still frequent in the execution of even 
minor criminals - as a tendency towards a more finely tuned justice, 
towards a closer penal mapping of the social body. Following a 
circular process, the threshold of the passage to violent crimes rises, 
intolerance to economic offences increases, controls become more 
thorough, penal interventions at once more premature and more 
numerous. 

If one compares this process with the critical discourse of the 
reformers, a remarkable strategic coincidence emerges. What they 
were attacking in traditional justice, before they set out the prin¬ 
ciples of a new penality, was certainly the excessive nature of the 
punishments; but an excess that was bound up with an irregularity 
even more than with an abuse of the power to punish. On 24 March 
1790, Thouret opened the debate in the Constituent Assembly on 
the new organization of the judicial power. In his view, this power 
had become 'denatured' in France in three ways. By private appro¬ 
priation: the offices of judge were sold; they were hereditary; they 
had a commercial value and, for that reason, the justice that was 
handed out was onerous. By a confusion between two types of 
power: that which dispenses justice and formulates a sentence by 
applying the law and that which creates the law itself. Lastly, by the 
existence of a whole series of privileges that made the implementa¬ 
tion of the law inconsistent: there were courts, procedures, litigants, 
even offences that were 'privileged' and fell outside common law 
(Archives parlementaires, XII, 344). This was only one of the many 
criticisms that had been levied at the legal system for the past fifty 
years at least, all of which denounced in this denaturation the 
principle of an irregular justice. Penal justice was irregular first of 
all by virtue of the multiplicity of courts responsible for assuring it, 
without ever forming a single and continuous pyramid (cf. Linguet 
or Boucher d'Argis, 1789). Quite apart from the ecclesiastical juris¬ 
dictions, we must take into account the discontinuities, overlappings 
and conflicts between the different legal systems: those of the 
nobility, which still played an important role in judging petty 
offences; those of the king, which were themselves numerous and 
badly coordinated (the sovereign courts were often in conflict with 


the bailiffs' courts and above all with the presidial courts, which had 
recently been created as intermediary instances); those which, dejure 
or de facto, were administered by governmental authorities (such as 
the in tendon ts, or provincial administrators) or police authorities 
(such as the provosts and police magistrates); to these should also 
be added the right possessed by the king or his representatives to 
take decisions on internment or exile quite outside any regular 
procedure. By their very plethora these innumerable authorities 
cancelled each other out and were incapable of covering the social 
body in its entirety. Paradoxically, their overlapping left penal 
justice with innumerable loopholes. This incompleteness was a result 
of differences of custom and procedure, despite the Ordonnance 
Ginerale of 1670; of internal conflicts of responsibility; of private 
interests - political or economic - which each authority found itself 
defending; and, lastly, of the interventions of the royal power, which 
could prevent, by means of pardons, commuted sentences, the evo¬ 
cation of a case before the royal council or direct pressure exerted 
on magistrates, the regular, austere course of justice. 

The criticism of the reformers was directed not so much at the 
weakness or cruelty of those in authority, as at a bad economy of 
power. There was too much power in the lower jurisdictions, which 
could - aided by the ignorance and poverty of those convicted - 
Ignore appeal procedure and carry out arbitrary sentences without 
adequate supervision; there was too much power on the side of the 
prosecution, which possessed almost unlimited means of pursuing 
its investigations, while the accused opposed it virtually unarmed - 
this led judges to be sometimes over-severe and sometimes, by way 
of reaction, too lenient; there was too much power in the hands of 
the judges who were able to content themselves with futile evidence, 
providing it was 'legal' evidence, and who were allowed too great 
a freedom in the choice of penalty; there was too much power in 
the hands of the 'gens du roi or royal magistrates, in relation to the 
accused, but also in relation to other magistrates; lastly, there was 
too much power exercised by the king, who could suspend courts 
of justice, alter their decisions, remove magistrates from office, or 
exile them, and replace them by judges acting under royal com¬ 
mission. The paralysis of justice was due not so much to a weakening 
as to a badly regulated distribution of power, to its concentration 


78 


79 






Punishment 


Generalized punishment 


at a certain number of points and to the conflicts and discontinuities 
that resulted. 

This dysfunction of power was related to a central excess: what 
might be called the monarchical ‘super-power', which identified the 
right to punish with the personal power of the sovereign. This 
theoretical identification made the king the fans justitiae; but the 
practical consequences of this were to be found even in that which 
appeared to oppose him and to limit his absolutism. It was because 
the king, in order to raise money, had appropriated the right to sell 
legal offices, which ‘belonged’ to him, that he was confronted by 
magistrates who owned their offices and who were not only intract¬ 
able, but ignorant, self-interested and frequently compromised. It 
was because he was constantly creating new offices that he multiplied 
the conflicts of power and authority. It was because he exercised too 
close a power over his 'gem' and conferred on them almost dis¬ 
cretionary powers that he intensified the conflicts within the magis- 
trature. It was because he had brought the law into conflict with too 
many summary acts of justice (the jurisdictions of the provosts or 
police magistrates) or with administrative measures, that he para¬ 
lysed normal justice, rendered it sometimes lenient and inconsistent, 
but sometimes over-hasty and severe.® 

It was not so much, or not only, the privileges of justice, its 
arbitrariness, its archaic arrogance, its uncontrolled rights that were 
criticized; but rather the mixture of its weaknesses and excesses, its 
exaggerations and its loopholes, and above all the very principle of 
this mixture, the ‘super-power' of the monarch. The true objective 
of the reform movement, even in its most general formulations, was 
not so much to establish a new right to punish based on more 
equitable principles, as to set up a new 'economy' of the power to 
punish, to assure its better distribution, so that it should be neither 
too concentrated at certain privileged points, nor too divided be¬ 
tween opposing authorities; so that it should be distributed in 
homogeneous circuits capable of operating everywhere, in a con¬ 
tinuous way, down to the finest grain of the social body . 4 The 
reform of criminal law must be read as a strategy for the rearrange¬ 
ment of the power to punish, according to modalities that render 
it more regular, more effective, more constant and more detailed in 
its effects; in short, which increase its effects while diminishing its 

80 


economic cost (that is to say, by dissociating it from the system of 
property, of buying and selling, of corruption in obtaining not only 
offices, but the decisions themselves) and its political cost (by dis¬ 
sociating it from the arbitrariness of monarchical power). The new 
juridical theory of penality corresponds in fact to a new ‘political 
economy’ of the power to punish. This explains why the ’reform’ 
did not have a single origin. It was not the more enlightened mem¬ 
bers of the public, nor the philosophcs , who regarded themselves as 
enemies of despotism and friends of mankind; it was not even the 
social groups opposed to the parlementaires who instigated the 
reform. Or rather it was not they alone; in this same overall project 
of a new distribution of the power to punish, and of a new distribu¬ 
tion of its effects, many different interests came together. The reform 
was not prepared outside the legal machinery and against all its 
representatives; it was prepared, for the most part, from within, by 
a large number of magistrates and on the basis of shared objectives 
and the power conflicts that divided them. Certainly the reformers 
did not form a majority of the magistrates; but it was a body of 
lawyers who outlined its general principles: a power to judge that 
would not be affected by the immediate exercise of the prince's 
sovereignty; that would be relieved of any claim to legislate; that 
would be detached from property relations; and which, having no 
other functions but to judge, would exercise that power to the full. 
In short, the power to judge should no longer depend on the 
innumerable, discontinuous, sometimes contradictory privileges of 
sovereignty, but on the continuously distributed effects of public 
power. This general principle defined an overall strategy that 
covered many different struggles. Those of philosophers like 
Voltaire and of publicists like Brissot or Marat; but also those of 
magistrates whose interests were nevertheless very diverse: Le 
Trosne, a judge at the presidial court of Orleans, and Lacretelle, the 
advocate-general at the parlement; Target, who with the parlements 
was opposed to Maupeou’s reform; but also J. N. Moreau, w'ho 
supported the royal power against the parlementaires; Servan and 
Dupaty, both magistrates, but in conflict with their colleagues, etc. 

Throughout the eighteenth century, inside and outside the legal 
apparatus, in both everyday penal practice and the criticism of 
institutions, one secs the emergence of a new strategy for the 

81 




Punishment 


Generalized punishment 


exercise of the power to punish. And 'reform’, in the strict sense, as 
it was formulated in the theories of law or as it was outlined in the 
various projects, was the political or philosophical resumption of 
this strategy, with its primary objectives: to make of the punishment 
and repression of illegalities a regular function, coextensive with 
society; not to punish less, but to punish better; to punish with an 
attenuated severity perhaps, but in order to punish with more 
universality and necessity; to insert the power to punish more deeply 
into the social body. 

The conjuncture that saw the birth of reform is not, therefore, 
that of a new sensibility, but that of another policy with regard to 
illegalities. 

Roughly speaking, one might say that, under the Ancien Regime 
each of the different social strata had its margin of tolerated illega¬ 
lity: the non-application of the rule, the non-observance of the 
innumerable edicts or ordinances were a condition of the political 
and economic functioning of society. This feature may not have 
been peculiar to the Ancien Regime. But illegality was so deeply 
rooted and so necessary to the life of each social stratum, that it had 
in a sense its own coherence and economy. Sometimes it took on an 
absolutely statutory form - as with the privileges accorded certain 
individuals and groups - which made it not so much an illegality 
as a regular exemption. Sometimes it took the form of a massive 
general non-observance, which meant that for decades, sometimes 
for centuries, ordinances could be published and constantly renewed 
without ever being implemented. Sometimes it was a matter of laws 
gradually falling into abeyance, then suddenly being reactivated; 
sometimes of silent consent on the part of the authorities, neglect, or 
quite simply the actual impossibility of imposing the law and appre¬ 
hending offenders. The least-favoured strata of the population did 
not have, in principle, any privileges: but they benefited, within the 
margins of what was imposed on them by law and custom, from a 
space of tolerance, gained by force or obstinacy; and this space was 
for them so indispensable a condition of existence that they were 
often ready to rise up to defend it; the attempts that were made 
periodically to reduce it, by reviving old laws or by improving the 
methods of apprehending, provoked popular disturbances, just as 


attempts to reduce certain privileges disturbed the nobility, the 
clergy and the bourgeoisie. 

This necessary illegality, of which every social stratum bore 
within itself specific forms, was caught up in a series of paradoxes. 
In its lower regions, it was identified with criminality, from which 
it was difficult to distinguish it juridically, if not morally: from fiscal 
illegality to customs illegality, to smuggling, to looting, to the 
armed struggle against the government’s taxation agents, then 
against the soldiers themselves and, finally, to rebellion, there was 
a continuity, in which it was difficult to mark the frontiers; or, again, 
vagabondage (severely punished according to the terms of ordin¬ 
ances that were never implemented) with the pillage, aggravated 
theft, even murder that went with it, provided a welcome environ¬ 
ment to the unemployed, to workers who had left their employers 

Fi in irregular circumstances, to domestic servants who had some 
reason to flee their masters, to ill-treated apprentices, to deserting 
soldiers, to all those who wished to escape the press-gang. So 
criminality merged into a wider illegality, to which the lower strata 
were attached as to conditions of existence; and, conversely, this 
illegality was a perpetual factor in the increase of crime. Hence an 
ambiguity in popular attitudes: on the one hand, the criminal - 
especially when he happened to be a smuggler or a peasant who had 
fled from the exactions of a master - benefited from a spontaneous 
wave of sympathy: his acts of violence were seen as descending 
directly from old struggles. On the other hand, a man who, under 
cover of an illegality accepted by the population, committed crimes 
at the expense of this population, the vagrant beggar, for example, 
who robbed and murdered, easily became the object of a special hate: 
he had redirected upon the least favoured illegality that was integral 
to their conditions of existence. Thus there grew up around crimes 
a network of glorification and blame; effective help and fear alter¬ 
nated with regard to this shifting population, which one knew was 
very near, but from which one felt that crime could emerge. 
Popular illegality enveloped a whole nucleus of criminality that was 
both its extreme form and its internal danger. 

Between this illegality of the depths and those of the other social 
castes, there was neither an exact convergence nor a profound opposi¬ 
tion. Generally speaking, the different illegalities proper to each

group maintained relations with one another that involved not only 
rivalry, competition and conflicts of interest, but also mutual help 
and complicity: the peasants’ refusal to pay certain state or eccle¬ 
siastical rents was not necessarily disapproved of by the landowners; 
the non-application by artisans of manufacturing regulations was 
often encouraged by the new entrepreneurs; smuggling - the story 
of Mandrin, welcomed by the entire population, received in castles 
and protected by parlemcniaircs proves this - was very widely 
supported. At most, one had seen in the seventeenth century the 
different fiscal refusals coalesce in serious revolts among widely 
separated social strata. In short, the reciprocal interplay of illegali¬ 
ties formed part of the political and economic life of society. Or 
rather, a number of transformations (the abeyance into which 
Colbert’s regulations had fallen, for example, the non-observance 
of customs barriers within the kingdom, the breakdown of guild 
practices) had operated in the breach that was being widened every 
day by popular illegality; the bourgeoisie had needed these trans¬ 
formations; and economic growth was due, in part, to them. 
Tolerance then became encouragement. 

In the second half of the eighteenth century, the process tended to 
be reversed. First, with the general increase in wealth, but also with 
the sudden demographic expansion, the principal target of popular 
illegality tended to be not so much rights, as goods: pilfering 
and theft tended to replace smuggling and the armed struggle 
against the tax agents. And, in this respect, the peasants, farmers 
and artisans were often its principal victims. Lc Trosne was no 
doubt exaggerating a real tendency when he described the peasants’ 
suffering under the exactions of vagabonds, even more than they 
had suffered under feudal demands: thieves now attacked them like 
a cloud of maleficent insects, devouring crops and depleting the 
granaries (Lc Trosne, 1764, 4). It might be said that gradually in 
the eighteenth century* a crisis of popular illegality had occurred; 
and neither the movements at the beginning of the Revolution 
(around the refusal of seigniorial rights), nor those later movements, 
in which the struggle against property rights, political and religious 
protests and the refusal of conscription came together, recombined 
illegality in its old, welcoming form. Furthermore, although a large 
part of the bourgeoisie had accepted, without too much trouble, 


the illegality of rights, it found it difficult to support illegality when 
it was a question of its own property rights. Nothing could be more 
typical of this than the problem of peasant delinquency at the end 
of the eighteenth century and especially after the Revolution 
(Berce, 161). The transition to an intensive agriculture exercised, 
over the rights to use common lands, over various tolerated prac¬ 
tices, over small accepted illegalities, a more and more restrictive 
pressure. Furthermore, as it was acquired in part by the bourgeoisie, 
now free of the feudal burdens that once weighed upon it, landed 
property became absolute property: all the tolerated ‘rights’ that 
the peasantry had acquired or preserved (the abandonment of old 
obligations or the consolidation of irregular practices: the right of 
free pasture, wood-collecting, etc.) were now rejected by the new 
owners who regarded them quite simply as theft (thus leading, 
among the people, to a series of chain reactions of an increasingly 
illegal, or, if one prefers the term, criminal kind: breaches of close, 
the theft or killing of cattle, fires, assaults, murders (cf. Festy 
and Agulhon). The illegality of rights, which often meant 
the survival of the most deprived, tended, with the new status of 
property, to become an illegality of property. It then had to be 
punished. 

And this illegality, while resented by the bourgeoisie where the 
ownership of land was concerned, was intolerable in commercial and 
industrial ownership: the development of the ports, the appearance 
of great warehouses in which merchandise w-as stored, the organiza¬ 
tion of huge workshops (with considerable quantities of raw 
materials, tools and manufactured articles, which belonged to the 
entrepreneurs and which were difficult to supervise) also necessitated 
a severe repression of illegality. The way in which wealth tended to 
be invested, on a much larger scale than ever before, in commodities 
and machines presupposed a systematic, armed intolerance of 
illegality. The phenomenon was obviously very evident where 
economic development was most intense. Colquhoun set out to 
give proof, supported by figures, of the urgent need to check the 
innumerable illegal practices that had grown up: according to the 
estimates of the entrepreneurs and insurance companies, the theft 
of produce imported from America and warehoused along the banks 
of the Thames had risen, on average, to £250,000 per annum; in

all, approximately £500,000 worth of goods was stolen each year 
in the Port of London itself (and this did not include the arsenals 
and warehouses outside the port proper); to this should be added 
£700,000 for the town itself. In this situation of permanent pilfering, 
three phenomena, says Colquhoun, should be taken into considera¬ 
tion: first, the complicity and often the active participation of the 
clerks, overseers, foremen and workers: ‘Whenever a large number 
of workers are gathered together in one place, there arc bound to be 
a lot of bad characters among them’; second, the existence of a whole 
organization of illicit commerce, which began in the workshops or 
docks, then passed on to the receivers - wholesale receivers, 
specializing in certain kinds of commodity, and retail receivers 
whose stalls offered a ‘wretched display of old iron, rags and worn 
clothes, whereas at the back of the shop were hidden naval munitions 
of great value, copper bolts and nails, pieces of cast iron and precious 
metals, produce from the West Indies, furniture and all kinds of 
goods bought from the labourers’ - then on to dealers and pedlars 
who distributed the stolen goods far into the countryside (Colqu¬ 
houn, 1797; in chapters VII, VIII and XV, he gives a very detailed 
account of this process); third, counterfeiting (it seems that there 
were between forty and fifty mints producing counterfeit money 
throughout England, in permanent operation). But what facilitated 
the work of this huge undertaking, involving both depredation and 
competition, was a whole set of tolerances: some amounted almost 
to acquired right (the right, for example, to collect bits of iron or 
rope around ships or to resell the sugar sweepings); others were of 
the nature of a moral acceptance; the pilferers themselves regarded 
their work as a kind of smuggling, which 'they did not regard as a 
serious offence’. 

It proved necessary, therefore, to control these illicit practices 
and introduce new legislation to cover them. The offences had to be 
properly defined and more surely punished; out of this mass of 
irregularities, sometimes tolerated and sometimes punished with a 
severity out of all proportion to the offence, one had to determine 
what was an intolerable offence, and the offenders had to be appre¬ 
hended and punished. With the new forms of capital accumulation, 
new relations of production and the new legal status of property, 
all the popular practices that belonged, either in a silent, everyday, 


tolerated form, or in a violent form, to the illegality of rights were 
reduced by force to an illegality of property. In that movement 
which transformed a society of juridico-political levies into a society 
of the appropriation of the means and products of labour, theft 
tended to become the first of the great loopholes in legality. Or, to 
put it another way, the economy of illegalities was restructured 
with the development of capitalist society. The illegality of property 
was separated from the illegality of rights. This distinction repre- 
%ents a class opposition because, on the one hand, the illegality 
that was to be most accessible to the lower classes was that of 


property - the violent transfer of ownership - and because, on the 
other, the bourgeoisie was to reserve to itself the illegality of rights: 
the possibility of getting round its own regulations and its own laws, 
of ensuring for itself an immense sector of economic circulation by 
a skilful manipulation of gaps in the law - gaps that were foreseen 
by its silences, or opened up by Je facto tolerance. And this great 
redistribution of illegalities was even to be expressed through a 
specialization of the legal circuits: for illegalities of property - for 
theft - there were the ordinary courts and punishments; for the 
illegalities of rights - fraud, tax evasion, irregular commercial 
operations - special legal institutions applied with transactions, 
imodations, reduced fines, etc. 'Hie bourgeoisie reserved to 
itself the fruitful domain of the illegality of rights. And at the same 
lime as this split was taking place, there emerged the need for 
.1 constant policing concerned essentially with this illegality of 
property. It became necessary to get rid of the old economy of the 
power to punish, based on the principles of the confused and in¬ 
adequate multiplicity of authorities, the distribution and concentra¬ 
tion of the power correlative with actual inertia and inevitable 
tolerance, punishments that were spectacular in their manifestations 
and haphazard in their application. It became necessary to define a 
strategy and techniques of punishment in which an economy of 
continuity and permanence would replace that of expenditure and 
rxcess. In short, penal reform was born at the point of junction 
Ixrtween the struggle against the super-power of the sovereign and 
that against the infra-power of acquired and tolerated illegalities. 
And if penal reform was anything more than the temporary result 
of a purely circumstantial encounter, it was because, between this 



Punishment 

super-power and this infra-power, a whole network of relations 
was being formed. By placing on the side of the sovereign the 
additional burden of a spectacular, unlimited, personal, irregular 
and discontinuous power, the form of monarchical sovereignty left 
the subjects free to practise a constant illegality; this illegality was 
like the correlative of this type of power. So much so that in attack¬ 
ing the various prerogatives of the sovereign one was also attacking 
the functioning of the illegalities. The two objectives were in con¬ 
tinuity. And, according to particular circumstances or tactics, the 
reformers laid more stress on one or the other. Le Trosne, the 
physiocrat who was a judge at the presidial court of Orleans, may 
serve as an example. In 1764, he published a memorandum on vaga¬ 
bondage: that hot-bed of thieves and murderers 'who live in the 
midst of society without being members of it', who wage 'a veritable 
war on all citizens’, and who are in the midst of us ‘in that state that 
one supposes existed before the establishment of civil society'. 
Against them, he demanded the most severe penalties (character¬ 
istically, he expressed surprise that one should be more indulgent 
towards them than to smugglers); he wanted the police to be rein¬ 
forced, the mounted constabulary to hunt them down with the help 
of the population that suffered from their depredations; he demanded 
that these useless and dangerous people should be 'acquired by the 
state and that they should belong to it as slaves to their masters'; 
and if necessary one should organize collective round-ups in the 
woods to drive them out, and anyone making a capture should be 
paid: ‘A reward of ten pounds is given for anyone who kills a wolf. 
A vagabond is infinitely more dangerous for society' (Le Trosne, 
1764, 8, 50, 54, 61-a). In 1777 in Vues sur la justice criminelle , the 
same Le Trosne demanded that the prerogatives of the Crown be 
reduced, that the accused be regarded as innocent until proved 
guilty, that the judge be a just arbiter between them and society, 
that laws be ‘fixed, constant, determined in the most precise way', 
so that subjects know 'to what they are exposed' and that magis¬ 
trates be nothing more than the 'organ of the law' (Lc Trosne, 1777, 
31, 37i 103-6). For Le Trosne, as for so many others at that time, 
the struggle for the delimitation of the power to punish was articu¬ 
lated directly on the need to subject popular illegality to a stricter 
and more constant control. It is understandable that the criticism 


88 


Generalized punishment 


of the public execution should have assumed such importance in 
penal reform: for it was the form in which, in the most visible way, 
the unlimited power of the sovereign and the ever-active illegality 
of the people came together. Humanity in the sentences was the 
rule given to a system of punishment that must fix their limits on 
both. The 'man' that must be respected in the sentence was the 
juridical and moral form given to this double delimitation. 

But, although it is true that reform, as a penal theory and as a 
strategy of the power to punish, took shape at the point of coinci¬ 
dence of these two objectives, its stability in the future was due to 
the fact that, for a long time, priority was given to the second. It was 
because the pressure on popular illegalities had become, at the period 

I of the Revolution, then under the Empire, and finally throughout 
the n.neteenth century, an essential imperative, that reform was able 
to pass from the project stage to that of an institution and set of 
practices. That is to say, although the new criminal legislation 
appears to be characterized by less severe penalties, a clearer codi¬ 
fication, a marked diminution of the arbitrary, a more generally 
accepted consensus concerning the power to punish (in the absence 
of a more real division in its exercise), it is sustained in reality by an 
upheaval in the traditional economy of illegalities and a rigorous 
application of force to maintain their new adjustment. A penal sys¬ 
tem must be conceived as a mechanism intended to administer 
illegalities differentially, not to eliminate them all. 

Shift the object and change the scale. Define new tactics in order 
to reach a target that is now more subtle but also more widely spread 
in the social body. Find new techniques for adjusting punishment to 
it and for adapting its effects. Lay down new principles for regulariz¬ 
ing, refining, universalizing the art of punishing. Homogenize its 
application. Reduce its economic and political cost by increasing its 
effectiveness and by multiplying its circuits. In short, constitute a 
new economy and a new technology of the power to punish: these 
are no doubt the essential raisons d’etre of penal reform in the 
eighteenth century. 

At the level of principles, this new strategy falls easily into the 
general theory of the contract. The citizen is presumed to have 
accepted once and for all, with the laws of society, the very law by 






Punishment

which he may be punished. Thus the criminal appears as a juridically 
paradoxical being. He has broken the pact, he is therefore the enemy 
of society as a whole, but he participates in the punishment that is 
practised upon him. The least crime attacks the whole of society; 
and the whole of society - including the criminal - is present in the 
least punishment. Penal punishment is therefore a generalized 
function, coextensive with the function of the social body and with 
each of its elements. This gives rise to the problem of the degree of 
punishment, the economy of the power to punish. 

In effect the offence opposes an individual to the entire social 
body; in order to punish him, society has the right to oppose him 
in its entirety. It is an unequal struggle: on one side are all the forces, 
all the power, all the rights. And this is how it should be, since the 
defence of each individual is involved. Thus a formidable right to 
punish is established, since the offender becomes the common 
enemy. Indeed, he is worse than an enemy, for it is from within 
society that he delivers his blows - he is nothing less than a traitor, 
a 'monster'. How could society not have an absolute right over him? 
How could it not demand, quite simply, his elimination? And, 
although it is true that the principle of punishment must be sub¬ 
scribed to in the pact, must not each citizen, logically, accept the 
extreme penalty for those of them who attack them as a body. 
'Every malefactor, by attacking the social rights, becomes, by his 
crimes, a rebel and a traitor to his country; by violating its laws he 
ceases to be a member of it; he even makes war upon it. In such a 
case the preservation of the state is inconsistent with his own, and 
one or the other must perish; in putting the guilty to death we slay 
not so much the citizen as the enemy.' 5 The right to punish has been 
shifted from the vengeance of the sovereign to the defence of 
society. But it now finds itself recombined with elements so strong 
that it becomes almost more to be feared. The malefactor has been 
saved from a threat that is by its very nature excessive, but he is 
exposed to a penalty that seems to be without bounds. It is a return 
to a terrible 'super-power'. It brings with it the need to establish a 
principle of moderation for the power of punishment. 

‘Who does not shudder with horror when reading in history of so 
many terrible and useless torments, invented and coldly applied by 
monsters who took upon themselves the name of sage?' (Beccaria, 


87). Or again: ‘The laws summon me to the greatest punishment 
of crimes. I go with all the fury that it has inspired in me. But 
what is this? They even go beyond it. . . God, who has imprinted 
in our hearts an aversion to pain for ourselves and for our fellow 
men, are they then those same beings, whom thou hast created so 
weak and so sensible, who have invented such barbarous, such 
refined tortures?' (Lacretclle, 129). The principle of moderation in 
punishment, even when it is a question of punishing the enemy of 
the social body, is articulated first as a discourse of the heart. Or 
rather, it leaps forth like a cry from the body, which is revolted at 
the sight or at the imagination of too much cruelty. The formulation 
of the principle that penality must remain 'humane' is expressed by 
the reformers in the first person. It is as if the sensibility of the 
speaker were being expressed directly; as if the body of the philoso¬ 
pher or theoretician had come, between executioner and victim, to 
affirm his own law and to impose it finally on the entire economy 
of punishment. Does this lyricism express an inability to find a 
raticnal foundation for a penal arithmetic? Between the contractual 
principle that expels the criminal from society and the image of the 
monster 'vomited' by nature, where is one to find a limit, if not in a 
human nature that is manifested - not in the rigour of the law, 
not in the ferocity of the delinquent - but in the sensibility 
of the reasonable man who makes the law and does not commit 
crime? 

But this recourse to 'sensibility' does not exactly express a 
theoretical impossibility. In fact, it bears within it a principle of 
calculation. The body, the imagination, pain, the heart to be re¬ 
spected are not, in effect, those of the criminal that is to be punished, 
but those of the men who, having subscribed to the pact, have the 
right of exercising against him the power of assembly. The pain that 
must exclude any reduction in punishment is that felt by the judges 
or spectators with all the hardness of heart that it may bring with it, 
all the ferocity induced by familiarity, or on the contrary, ill- 
founded feelings of pity and indulgence: ‘Thank God for those 
gentle, sensitive souls on whom those horrible executions exert a 
kind of torture' (Lacretelle, 131). What has to be arranged and 
calculated are the return effects of punishment on the punishing 
authority and the power that it claims to exercise. 







Punishment 


Generalized punishment 


Here the principle takes root that one should never apply ‘in¬ 
humane' punishments to a criminal, who, nevertheless, may well be 
a traitor and a monster. If the law must now treat in a 'humane' way 
an individual who is 'outside nature' (whereas the old justice treated 
the 'outlaw' inhumanely), it is not on account of some profound 
humanity that the criminal conceals within him, but because of a 
necessary regulation of the effects of power. It is this 'economic' 
rationality that must calculate the penalty and prescribe the appro¬ 
priate techniques. 'Humanity' is the respectable name given to this 
economy and to its meticulous calculations. 'Where punishment is 
concerned, the minimum is ordered by humanity and counselled by 
policy.’ a 

So, in order to understand this techno-politics of punishment, let 
us take the extreme case, the ultimate crime: a deed of such enormity 
that it violates all the most respected laws. It is produced in circum¬ 
stances so extraordinary, in such profound secrecy, with such lack 
of restraint, as if at the very limit of possibility, that it could not 
be other than unique, in any case the last of its kind: no one could 
ever imitate it; no one could take it as an example, or even feel 
scandalized that it should have been committed. It is doomed to 
disappear without trace. This fable 7 of the 'ultimate crime’ is, to the 
new penality, what original sin was to the old: the pure form in 
which the reason for punishment appears. 

Ought such a crime to be punished? According to what calcula¬ 
tion? Of what use could its punishment be in the economy of the 
power to punish? It would be useful to the extent that it could make 
reparation for 'the harm done to society’ (Pastoret, II, at). Now, 
if one sets aside the strictly material damage - which even when it is 
irreparable as in the case of a murder is of little account in relation 
to society as a whole - the injury that a crime inflicts upon the 
social body is the disorder that it introduces into it: the scandal that 
it gives rise to, the example that it gives, the incitement to repeat it 
if it is not punished, the possibility of becoming widespread that it 
bears within it. In order to be useful, punishment must have as its 
objective the consequences of the crime, that is to say, the series of 
disorders that it is capable of initiating: 'The proportion between 
the penalty and the quality of the offence is determined by the 
influence that the violation of the pact has on the social order’ 


(Filangieri, 214). But this influence of a crime is not necessarily in 
direct proportion to its horror; a crime that horrifies the conscience 
is often of less effect than an offence that everyone tolerates and feels 
quite ready to imitate. There is a scarcity of great crimes; on the 
other hand, there is the danger that everyday offences may multiply. 
So one must not seek a qualitative relation between the crime and 
its punishment, an equivalence of horror: 'Can the cries of a wretch 
in torment bring back from the depths of a past that cannot return 
an action that has already been committed?' (Beccaria, 87). One 
must calculate a penalty in terms not of the crime, but of its possible 
repetition. One must take into account not the past offence, but the 
future disorder. Things must be so arranged that the malefactor can 
have neither any desire to repeat his offence, nor any possibility of 
having imitators.* Punishment, then, will be an art of effects; rather 
than opposing the enormity of the penalty to the enormity of the 
crime, one must adjust to one another the two series that follow 
from the crime: its own effects and those of the penalty. A crime 
without a dynasty does not call for punishment; any more than, 
according to another version of the same fable, a society on the 
verge of dissolution and disappearance would have the right to erect 
scaffolds. The last crime cannot but remain unpunished. 

This was an old view. The function of punishment as example 
was to be found long before the eighteenth-century reform. That 
punishment looks towards the future, and that at least one of its 
major functions is to prevent crime had, for centuries, been one of 
the current justifications of the right to punish. But the difference 
was that the prevention that was expected as an effect of the punish¬ 
ment and its spectacle - and therefore of its excess - tended now to 
become the principle of its economy and the measure of its just 
proportions. One must punish exactly enough to prevent repetition. 
There is, then, a shift in the mechanics of example: in a penality 
employing public torture and execution, example was the answer 
to the crime; it had, by a sort of twin manifestation, to show the 
crime and at the same time to show the sovereign power that 
mastered it; in a penality calculated according to its own effects, 
example must refer back to the crime, but in the most discreet w-ay 
possible and with the greatest possible economy indicate the inter¬ 
vention of pbwer; ideally, too, it should prevent any subsequent

reappearance of either. The example is no longer a ritual that mani¬ 
fests; it is a sign that serves as an obstacle. Through this technique of 
punitive signs, which tends to reverse the whole temporal field of 
penal action, the reformers thought they were giving to the power 
to punish an economic, effective instrument that could be made 
general throughout the entire social body, capable of coding all its 
behaviour and consequently of reducing the whole diffuse domain 
of illegalities. The semio-technique with which one tried to arm the 
power to punish rested on five or six major rules. 

The rule of minimum quantity. A crime is committed because it 
procures certain advantages. If one linked, to the idea of crime, the 
idea of a slightly greater disadvantage, it would cease to be desir¬ 
able. ‘For punishment to produce the effect that must be expected of 
it, it is enough that the harm that it causes exceed the good that the 
criminal has derived from the crime’ (Bcccaria, 89). A proximity 
between penalty and crime can, indeed must, be accepted; but no 
longer in its old form, where the public execution had to be equi¬ 
valent in intensity to the crime, with an additional factor that 
marked the ‘surplus power’ of the sovereign carrying out his legiti¬ 
mate vengeance; it is a quasi-equivalence at the level of interests: a 
little more interest in avoiding the penalty than in risking the crime. 

The rule of sufficient ideality. If the motive of a crime is the 
advantage expected of it, the effectiveness of the penalty is the dis¬ 
advantage expected of it. This means that the ’pain' at the heart of 
punishment is not the actual sensation of pain, but the idea of pain, 
displeasure, inconvenience - the ‘pain’ of the idea of’pain’. Punish¬ 
ment has to make use not of the body, but of representation. Or 
rather, if it does make use of the body, it is not so much as the sub¬ 
ject of a pain as the object of a representation: the memory of pain 
must prevent a repetition of the crime, just as the spectacle, how¬ 
ever artificial it may be, of a physical punishment may prevent the 
contagion of a crime. But it is not pain in itself that will be the 
instrument of the technique of punishment. Therefore, as long as 
possible, and except in cases requiring an effective representation, 
one should avoid recourse to the great panoply of the scaffold. 
There is an elision of the body as the subject of the punishment, but 
not necessarily as an clement in a spectacle. The rejection of the 
public execution which, at the threshold of the theory, had found 


no more than a lyrical expression, was now offered the possibility 
of a rational articulation: what must be maximized is the representa¬ 
tion of the penalty, not its corporal reality. 

The rule of lateral effects. The penalty must have its most intense 
effects on those who have not committed the crime; to carry the 
argument to its limit, if one could be sure that the criminal could not 
repeat the crime, it would be enough to make others believe that he 
had been punished. There is a centrifugal intensification of effects, 
which leads to the paradox that in the calculation of penalties the 
least important element is still the criminal (unless he is likely to 
repeat the offence). Beccaria illustrated this paradox in the punish¬ 
ment that he proposed to replace the death sentence - perpetual 
slavery. Is this not a physically more cruel punishment than death? 
Not at all, he says: because the pain of slavery, for the condemned 
man, is divided into as many portions as he has moments left to live; 
it is an infinitely divisible penalty, an Eleatic penalty, much less 
severe than capital punishment, which is only one step away from 
the public execution. On the other hand, for those who sec these 
slaves, or represent them to themselves, the pains they bear are 
concentrated into a single idea; all the moments of slavery are 
contracted into a representation that then becomes more terrifying 
than the idea of death. It is the economically ideal punishment: it 
is minimal for him who undergoes it (and who, reduced to slavery, 
cannot repeat his crime) and it is maximal for him who represents it 
to himself. ‘Among the penalties, and in the way of applying them 
in proportion to the offences, one must choose the means that will 
leave the most lasting impression on the minds of the people, and 
the least cruel on the body of the criminal' (Beccaria, 87). 

The rule of perfect certainty. With the idea of each crime and the 
advantages to be expected of it must be associated the idea of a 
particular punishment with the precise inconveniences that result 
from it; the link from one to the other must be regarded as necessary 
and unbreakable. This general element of certainty that must give 
the system of punishment its effectiveness involves a number of 
precise measures. The laws that define the crime and lay down the 
penalties must be perfectly clear, ‘so that each member of society 
may distinguish criminal actions from virtuous actions’ (Brissot, 
24). These laws must be published, so that everyone has access to

them; what is needed is not oral traditions and customs, but a written 
legislation which can be 'the stable monument of the social pact', 
printed texts available to all: 'Only printing can make the public as 
a whole and not just a lew persons depositories of the sacred code of 
the laws’ (Beccaria, 26). The monarch must renounce his right of 
pardon so that the force that is present in the idea of punishment 
is not attenuated by the hope of intervention: ‘If one allows men to 
see that the crime may be pardoned and that punishment is not a 
necessary consequence of it, one nourishes in them the hope of 
going unpunished. . . The laws must be inexorable, those who 
execute them inflexible.’ 9 Above all, no crime committed must 
escape the gaze of those whose task it is to dispense justice. Nothing 
so weakens the machinery of the law than the hope of going un¬ 
punished; how could one establish in the minds of the public a strict 
link between the offence and a penalty if it were affected by a certain 
coefficient of improbability? Would it not be necessary to make the 
penalty the more to be feared in its violence as it is less to be feared 
in its uncertainty? Rather than imitate the old system in this way 
and be 'more severe, one must be more vigilant’. 10 Hence the idea 
that the machinery of justice must be duplicated by an organ of 
surveillance that would work side by side with it, and which would 
make it possible either to prevent crimes, or, if committed, to arrest 
their authors; police and justice must work together as tw-o comple¬ 
mentary actions of the same process - the police assuring 'the action 
of society on each individual’, justice ’the rights of individuals 
against society' (Duport, Archives parlementaires, XXI, 45). Thus 
every crime will come to the light of day and be punished in all 
certainty. But it is also necessary that the legal procedures should 
not remain secret, that the reasons why a defendant is condemned or 
acquitted should be know n to all, and each individual must be able 
to recognize the reasons for a penalty: ‘Let the magistrate speak his 
opinion aloud, let him be obliged to read in his judgement the text 
of the law that condemns the defendant. . . Let the procedures that 
are buried mysteriously in the obscurity of the records office be 
opened to all citizens who arc concerned at the fate of the con¬ 
demned’ (Mably, 348). 

The rule ofcommon truth. Beneath this ordinary-seeming principle 
is hidden an important transformation. The old system of legal 


proofs, the use of torture, the extraction of confessions, the use of 
the public execution, the body and spectacle for the reproduction 
of truth had long isolated penal practice from the common forms of 
demonstration: semi-proofs produced semi-truths and semi-guilty 
persons, words extracted by pain had greater authenticity, presump¬ 
tion involved a degree of punishment. The heterogeneity of this 
system with the ordinary system of proof really constituted a scandal 
only when the power to punish needed, for its own economy, a 
climate of irrefutable certainty. How can one link absolutely in the 
minds of men the idea of crime and the idea of punishment, if the 
reality of the punishment does not follow, in all cases, the reality 
of the offence? To establish the offence, in all evidence, and accord¬ 
ing to’ the means valid for all, becomes a task of first importance. 
The verification of the crime must obey the general criteria for all 
truth. In the arguments it employs, in the proofs it provides, legal 
judgement must be homogeneous with judgement in general. There 
is, therefore, an abandonment of legal proof, a rejection of torture, 
the need for a complete demonstration of the truth, an cffaccment 
of all correlation between degrees of suspicion and degrees of 
punishment. Like a mathematical truth, the truth of the crime will 
be accepted only when it is completely proven. It follows that, up 
to the final demonstration of his crime, the defendant must be 
regarded as innocent; and that, in order to carry out this demonstra¬ 
tion, the judge must use not ritual forms, but common instruments, 
that reason possessed by everyone, which is also that of philoso¬ 
phers and scientists: 'In theory, I regard the magistrate as a philoso¬ 
pher who sets out to discover an interesting truth. . . His sagacity 
will enable him to grasp all the circumstances and all the relations, 
bring together or separate w-hatever needs to be brought together 
or separated in order to arrive at a sane judgement' (Seigneux de 
Correvon, 49). The investigation, the exercise of common reason, 
lays aside the old inquisitorial model and adopts the much more 
subtle model (doubly validated by science and common sense) of 
empirical research. The judge will be like a 'pilot steering between 
the rocks’: ‘What proofs or what clues will be considered to be 
sufficient neither I nor anyone else has dared to determine in general; 
since circumstances are subject to infinite variations, since proofs 
and clues must be deduced from these circumstances, the clearest 


Punishment 


clues and proofs must necessarily vary in proportion' (Risi, 53). 
Henceforth, penal practice was to be subject to a common rule of 
truth, or rather to a complex rule in which heterogeneous elements 
of scientific demonstration, the evidence of the senses and common 
sense come together to form the judge's ‘deep-seated conviction'. 
Although penal justice preserves the forms that guarantee its equity, 
it may now be opened up to all manner of truths, providing they 
are evident, well founded, acceptable to all. The legal ritual in itself 
no longer generates a divided truth. It is resituated in the field of 
reference of common proofs. With the multiplicity of scientific 
discourses, a difficult, infinite relation was then forged that penal 
justice is still unable to control. The master of justice is no longer 
the master of its truth. 

The rule of optimal specification. For penal semiotics to cover the 
whole field of illegalities that one wishes to eliminate, all offences 
must be defined; they must be classified and collected into species 
from which none of them can escape. A code is therefore necessary 
and this code must be sufficiently precise for each type of offence to 
be clearly present in it. The silence of the law must not harbour the 
hope of impunity. An exhaustive, explicit code is required, defining 
crimes and fixing penalties. (On this theme, cf., among others, 
Linguct, 8.) But the same imperative need for a total coincidence 
between all possible offences and the effects-signs of punishment 
forces one to go further. The idea of the same punishment docs not 
have the same effect on everyone: the rich do not fear fines nor the 
notorious infamy. The injury caused by an offence and its value as 
example differ according to the status of the offender; a crime 
committed by a noble is more injurious to society than one com¬ 
mitted by a man of the people (Lacretelle, 144). Lastly, since punish¬ 
ment must prevent a repetition of the offence, it must take into 
account the profound nature of the criminal himself, the presumable 
degree of his wickedness, the intrinsic quality of his will: 'Of two 
men who have committed the same theft, how much less guilty is he 
who scarcely had the necessities of life than he who overflowed with 
excess? Of two perjurers, how much more criminal is he on whom 
one has striven from his childhood to impress feelings of honour 
than he who, abandoned to nature, never received the benefit of 
education’ (Marat, 34). One sees the emergence at the same time of 


98 


Generalized punishment 


the need for a parallel classification of crimes and punishments, the 
need for an individualization of sentences, in accordance with the 
particular characteristics of each criminal. This individualization was 
to weigh very heavily throughout the history of modern penal law; 
it is rooted precisely here: in terms of the theory of law and accord¬ 
ing to the requirements of everyday practice, it is no doubt in 
radical opposition to the principle of codification; but from the 
standpoint of the economy of the power to punish, and of the 
techniques by which one wishes to circulate throughout the social 
body precisely calibrated signs of punishment, with neither excesses 
nor loopholes, with neither a useless 'expenditure' of power nor with 
timidity, it becomes evident that the codification of the offences- 
punishments system and the modulation of the criminal-punish¬ 
ment dyad go side by side, each requiring the other. Individualiza¬ 
tion appears as the ultimate aim of a precisely adapted code. 

But this individualization is very different in its nature from the 
modulations of punishment to be found in the old jurisprudence. 
The old system - and on this point it followed Christian peniten¬ 
tiary practice - used two scries of variables to adjust the punishment, 
those of'circumstances' and those of‘intention’; elements, that is to 
say, that made it possible to qualify the act itself. The modulation 
of the penalty belonged to ‘casuistry’ in the broad sense. (On the 
non-individualizing character of casuistry, cf. Cariou.) But what 
was now beginning to emerge was a modulation that referred to the 
defendant himself, to his nature, to his way of life and his attitude of 
m nd, to his past, to the 'quality* and not to the intention of his will. 
One perceives, but as a place as yet unfilled, the locus in which, in 
penal practice, psychological knowledge will take over the role of 
casuistic jurisprudence. Of course, at the end of the eighteenth 
century, that moment was still far off. The code-individualization 
link was sought in the scientific models of the period. Natural 
history no doubt offered the most adequate schema: the taxonomy 
of species according to an uninterrupted gradation. One sought to 
constitute a Linnaeus of crimes and punishments, so that each 
particular offence and each punishable individual might come, with¬ 
out the slightest risk of any arbitrary action, within the provisions 
of a general law. 'A table must be drawn up of all the genera of 
crimes to be observed in different countries. According to the 


99 






Punishment 


Generalized punishment 


enumeration ol crimes, a division into species must be carried out. 
The best rule of this division is, it seems to me, to separate the 
crimes according to their objects. This division must be such that 
each species is quite distinct from another, and that each particular 
crime, considered in all its relations may be placed between that 
which must precede it and that which must follow it, in the strictest 
gradation; lastly, this table must be such that it may be compared 
with another table that will be drawn up for penalties, in such a way 
that they may correspond exactly to one another’ (Lacretelle, 351- 
352). In theory, or rather in dream, the double taxonomy of 
punishments and crimes will solve the problem: but how is one to 
apply fixed laws to particular individuals? 

Far removed from this speculative model, forms of anthropologi¬ 
cal individualization were being constituted at the same period in 
what was still a very rough and ready way. Let us take first the 
notion of the repetition of crime. Not that this was unknown to the 
old criminal laws. 11 But it was tending to become a description 
of the defendant himself capable of altering the sentence passed: 
according to the legislation of 1791, recidivists were liable in almost 
all cases to a doubling of the penalty; according to the law of Flor&l 
Year X, they had to be branded with the letter R; and the penal code 
of 1810 inflicted on them cither the maximum possible of the normal 
penalty, or the penalty immediately above it. Now, through the 
repetition of the crime, what one was aiming at was not the author 
of an act defined by law, but the delinquent subject himself, a certain 
will that manifested his intrinsically criminal character. Gradually, 
as criminality, rather than crime, became the object of penal inter¬ 
vention, the opposition between first offender and recidivist tended 
to become more important. And on the basis of this opposition, 
reinforcing it on several points, one sees at the same period the 
formation of the notion of the 'crime passionel' - an involuntary, 
unpremeditated crime, bound up with extraordinary circumstances, 
which, while not offering the same excuse as madness, nevertheless 
prevented it from being regarded as an ordinary crime. As early as 
1791, Lc Peletier remarked that the subtle gradation of penalties 
that he had presented to the Constituent Assembly might dissuade 
from crime ‘the evil-doer who plans a wicked action in cold blood’, 
and who may be restrained by thoughts of the penalty; but, on the 


other hand, it was powerless against crimes due to ‘violent passions 
that have no regard to consequences’; this, however, was unimport¬ 
ant, since such crimes revealed in their authors ‘no reasoned wicked¬ 
ness.’ 1 * 

Beneath the humanization of the penalties, what one finds are all 
those rules that authorize, or rather demand, ’leniency’, as a calcu¬ 
lated economy of the power to punish. But they also provoke a 
shift in the point of application of this power: it is no longer the 
body, with the ritual play of excessive pains, spectacular brandings 
in the ritual of the public execution; it is the mind or rather a play 
of representations and signs circulating discreetly but necessarily 
and evidently in the minds of all. It is no longer the body, but the 
soul, said Mably. And we see very clearly what he meant by this 
term: the correlative of a technique of power. Old ’anatomies' of 
punishment are abandoned. But have we really entered the age of 
non-corporal punishment? 

At the point of departure, then, one may place the political 
project of rooting out illegalities, generalizing the punitive function 
and delimiting, in order to control it, the power to punish. From 
this there emerge two lines of objectification of crime and of the 
criminal. On the one hand, the criminal designated as the enemy of 
all, whom it is in the interest of all to track down, falls outside the 
pact, disqualifies himself as a citizen and emerges, bearing within 
him as it were, a wild fragment of nature; he appears as a villain, 
a monster, a madman, perhaps, a sick and, before long, ‘abnormal’ 
individual. It is as such that, one day, he will belong to a scientific 
objectification and to the 'treatment' that is correlative to it. On the 
other hand, the need to measure, from within, the effects of the 
punitive power prescribes tactics of intervention over all criminals, 
actual or potential: the organization of a field of prevention, the 
calculation of interests, the circulation of representations and signs, 
the constitution of a horizon of certainty and proof, the adjustment 
of penalties to ever more subtle variables; all this also leads to an 
objectification of criminals and crimes. In either case, one sees that 
the power relation that underlies the exercise of punishment begins 
to be duplicated by an object relation in which are caught up not 
only die crime as a fact to be established according to common 



Punishment 


Generalized punishment 


norms, but the criminal as an individual to be known according 
to specific criteria. One also sees that this object relation is not 
superimposed, from the outside, on the punitive practice, as would 
be a prohibition laid on the fury of the public execution by the 
limits of the sensibility, or as would be a rational or 'scientific' 
interrogation as to what this man that one is punishing really is. The 
processes of objectification originate in the very tactics of power and 
of the arrangement of its exercise. 

However, the two types of objectification that emerge with the 
project of penal reform are very different from one another: both in 
their chronology and in their effects. The objectification of the 
criminal as outside the law, as natural man, is still only a potentiality, 
a vanishing trace, in which are entangled the themes of political 
criticism and the figures of the imagination. One will have to wait a 
long time before homo crimina/is becomes a definite object in the 
field of knowledge. The other, on the contrary, has had much more 
rapid and decisive effects in so far as it was linked more directly 
to the reorganization of the power to punish: codification, definition 
of offences, the fixing of a scale of penalties, rules of procedure, 
definition of the role of magistrates. And also because it made use 
of the discourse already constituted by the Ideologues. This discourse 
provided, in effect, by means of the theory of interests, representa¬ 
tions and signs, by the series and geneses that it reconstituted, a sort 
of general recipe for the exercise of power over men: the 'mind' as 
a surface of inscription for power, with semiology as its tool; the 
submission of bodies through the control of ideas; the analysis of 
representations as a principle in a politics of bodies that was much 
more effective than the ritual anatomy of torture and execution. The 
thought of the Ideologues was not only a theory of the individual 
and society; it developed as a technology of subtle, effective, 
economic powers, in opposition to the sumptuous expenditure of 
the power of the sovereign. Let us hear once more what Servan has 
to say: the ideas of crime and punishment must be strongly linked 
and ‘follow one another without interruption. . . When you have 
thus formed the chain of ideas in the heads of your citizens, you will 
then be able to pride yourselves on guiding them and being their 
masters. A stupid despot may constrain his slaves with iron chains; 
but a true politician binds them even more strongly by the chain of 


their own ideas; it is at the stable point of reason that he secures the 
end of the chain; this link is all the stronger in that we do not know 
of what it is made and we believe it to be our own work; despair 
and time eat away the bonds of iron and steel, but they are power¬ 
less against the habitual union of ideas, they can only tighten it still 
more; and on the soft fibres of the brain is founded the unshakable 
base of the soundest of Empires' (Servan, 3 f)- 
It is this semio-techniquc of punishments, this ‘ideological 
power' which, partly at least, will remain in suspense and will be 
superseded by a new political anatomy, in which the body, once 
again, but in a new form, will be the principal character. And this 
new political anatomy will permit the intersection of the two 
divergent lines of objectification that are to be seen emerging in the 
eighteenth century: that which rejects the criminal 'from the other 
side' - from the side of a nature against nature; and that which seeks 
to control delinquency by a calculated economy of punishments. A 
glance at the new art of punishing clearly reveals the supersession 
of the punitive semio-techniquc by a new politics of the body. 




The gentle way in punishment 


2. The gentle way in punishment 


The art of punishing, then, must rest on a whole technology of 
representation. The undertaking can succeed only if it forms part of 
a natural mechanics. 'Like the gravitation of bodies, a secret force 
compels us ever towards our well-being. This impulsion is affected 
only by the obstacles that laws oppose to it. All the diverse actions 
of man are the effects of this interior tendency.' To find the suitable 
punishment for a crime is to find the disadvantage whose idea is 
such that it robs for ever the idea of a crime of any attraction. It 
is an art of conflicting energies, an art of images linked by associa¬ 
tion, the forging of stable connections that defy time: it is a matter 
of establishing the representation of pairs of opposing values, of 
establishing quantitative differences between the opposing forces, 
of setting up a complex of obstacle-signs that may subject the 
movement of the forces to a power relation. 'Let the idea of torture 
and execution be ever present in the heart of the weak man and 
dominate the feeling that drives him to crime' (Beccaria, 119). These 
obstacle-signs must constitute the new arsenal of penalties, just as the 
old public executions were organized around a system of retaliatory 
marks. But in order to function, they must obey several conditions. 

t. They must be as unarbitrary as possible. It is true that it is 
society that defines, in terms of its own interests, what must be 
regarded as a crime: it is not therefore natural. But, if punishment 
is to present itself to the mind as soon as one thinks of committing a 
crime, as immediate a link as possible must be made between the 
two: a link of resemblance, analogy, proximity. The penalty must 
be made to conform as closely as possible to the nature of the 
offence, so that fear of punishment diverts the mind from the road 
along which the prospect of an advantageous crime was leading it' 
(Beccaria, 119). The ideal punishment would be transparent to the 


crime that it punishes; thus, for him who contemplates it, it will be 
infallibly the sign of the crime that it punishes; and for him who 
dreams of the crime, the idea of the offence will be enough to arouse 
the sign of the punishment. This is an advantage for the stability of 
the link, an advantage for the calculation of the proportions between 
crime and punishment and the quantitative reading of interests; it 
also has the advantage that, by assuming the form of a natural 
sequence, punishment does not appear as the arbitrary- effect of a 
human power: 'To derive the offence from the punishment is the 
best means of proportioning punishment to crime. If this is the 
triumph of justice, it is also the triumph of liberty, for then penalties 
no longer proceed from the will of the legislator, but from the nature 
of things; one no longer sees man committing violence on man' 
(Marat, 33). In analogical punishment, the power that punishes is 
hidden. 

The reformers proposed a whole panoply of penalties that were 
natural by institution and which represented in their form the 
content of the crime. Take Vermeil, for example: those who abuse 
public liberty will be deprived of their own; those who abuse the 
benefits of law and the privileges of public office will be deprived of 
their civil rights; speculation and usury will be punished by fines; 
theft will be punished by confiscation; 'vainglory' by humiliation; 
murder by death; fire-raising by the stake. In the case of the poi¬ 
soner, 'the executioner will present him w ith a goblet the contents 
of which w ill be thrown into his face; thus he will be made to feel 
the horror of his crime by being offered an image of it; he w-ill then 
be dirown into a cauldron of boiling water' (Vermeil, 68-145; cf. 
also Dufriche de Valaze, 349) Mere day-dreaming? Perhaps. But 
the principle of a symbolic communication was clearly formulated 
by Le Peletier, when in 1791 be presented the new criminal legisla¬ 
tion: 'Exact relations are required between the nature of the offence 
and the nature of the punishment'; he w ho has used violence in his 
crime must be subjected to physical pain; he who has been lazy 
must be sentenced to hard labour; he w ho has acted despicably will 
be subjected to infamy (Lc Peletier, 321-1). 

Despite cruelties that are strongly reminiscent of the tortures of 
the Ancien Regime, a quite different mechanism is at work in these 
analogical penalties. Horror is not opposed to horror in a joust of 


104

Punishment 


The gentle way in punishment 


power; it is no longer the symmetry of vengeance, but the trans¬ 
parency of the sign to that which it signifies; what is required is to 
establish, in the theatre of punishments, a relation that is immedi¬ 
ately intelligible to the senses and on which a simple calculation may 
be based: a sort of reasonable aesthetic of punishment. ‘It is not only 
in the fine arts that one must follow nature faithfully; political 
institutions, at least those that display wisdom and permanence, are 
founded on nature' (Beccaria, 114). The punishment must proceed 
from the crime; the law must appear to be a necessity of things, and 
power must act while concealing itself beneath the gentle force of 
nature. 

1. This complex of signs must engage with the mechanics of 
forces: reduce the desire that makes the crime attractive; increase 
the interest that makes the penalty be feared; reverse the relation of 
intensities, so that the representation of the penalty and its dis¬ 
advantages is more lively than that of the crime and its pleasures. 
There is a whole mechanics, therefore, of interest, of its movement, 
of the way that one represents it to oneself and of the liveliness of 
this representation. 'The legislator must be a skilful architect who 
knows how to employ all the forces that may contribute to the 
solidity of the building and reduce all those that might ruin it' 
(Beccaria, 135). 

There arc several ways of achieving this. 'Go straight to the 
source of evil* (Mably, 246). Smash the mainspring that animates the 
representation of the crime. Weaken the interest that brought it to 
birth. Behind the offences of the vagabond, there is laziness; that 
is what one must fight against. 'One will not succeed by locking 
beggars up in filthy prisons that are more like cesspools’; they will 
have to be forced to work. ‘The best way of punishing them is to 
employ them' (Brissot, 258). Against a bad passion, a good habit; 
against a force, another force, but it must be the force of sensibility 
and passion, not that of armed power. 'Must one not deduce all 
penalties from this principle, which is so simple, so appropriate and 
already well known, namely, to choose them in that which is most 
subduing for the passion that led to the crime committed?’ (Lacre- 
telle, 361). 

Set the force that drove the criminal to the crime against itself. 
Divide interest, use it to make the penalty something to be feared. 


Lei the punishment irritate it and stimulate it more than the crime 
was able to flatter it. If pride led to the committing of a crime, let 
it be hurt, let the punishment disgust it. Shameful punishments are 
effective because they are based on the vanity that was at the root 
of the crime. Fanatics glory both in their opinions and in the tor¬ 
tures that they endure for them. Let us, therefore, set against 
fanaticism the proud obstinacy that sustains it: 'Reduce it with 
ridicule and shame; if one humiliates the proud vanity of fanatics 
before a great crowd of spectators, one may expect happy effects 
frem this punishment.' It would be quite useless, on the other hand, 
to impose physical pain on them. (Beccaria, 113). 

Reanimate the useful, virtuous interest that has been so weakened 
by the crime. The feeling of respect for property - for wealth, but 
also for honour, liberty, life - this the criminal loses when he robs, 
calumniates, abducts or kills. So he must be taught this feeling 
once again. And one will begin by teaching it to him for his own 
benefit; one will show him what it is to lose the freedom to dispose 
as one wdshes of one’s own wealth, honour, time and body, so that 
he may respect it in others (Pastorct, I, 49). The penalty that forms 
stable and easily legible signs must also recompose the economy of 
interests and the dynamics of passions. 

3. Consequently, one must use a temporal modulation. The 
penalty transforms, modifies, establishes signs, arranges obstacles. 
What use would it be if it had to be permanent? A penalty that had 
no end would be contradictory: all the constraints that it imposes on 
the convict and of which, having become virtuous once more, he 
would never be able to take advantage, would be little better than 
torture; and the effort made to reform him would be so much 
trouble and expense lost by society. If incorrigibles there be, one 
must be determined to eliminate them. But, for all the others, 
punishment can function only if it comes to an end. This analysis 
was accepted by the Constituent Assembly: the code of 1791 lays 
down the death penalty for traitors and murderers; all other penalties 
must have an end (the maximum is twenty years). 

But above all the role of duration must be integrated into the 
rconomy of the penalty. In its very violence, the public execution 
tended to have the following result: the more serious the crime, the 
diorter the punishment. Duration certainly intervened in the old 


Punishment 


The gentle way in punishment 


system of penalties; days at the pillory, years of banishment, hours 
spent dying on the wheel. But it was a time of ordeal, not of con¬ 
certed transformation. Duration must now facilitate the proper 
action of the punishment: 'A prolonged succession of painful priva¬ 
tions, sparing mankind the horror of torture, has much more effect 
on the guilty party than a passing moment of pain... It constantly 
renews in the eyes of the people that witness it the memory of 
vengeful laws and revives in all the moments of a salutary terror.’ 1 
Time, operator of punishment. 

But the delicate mechanism of the passions must not be con¬ 
strained in the same way or with the same insistence when they 
begin to improve; the punishment should diminish as it produces its 
effects. It may well be fixed, in the sense that it is determined for all, 
in the same way, by law, but its internal mechanism must be variable. 
In the bill put before the Constituent Assembly, Le Pcletier pro¬ 
posed a system of diminishing penalties: a convict condemned to 
the most serious penalty would be subjected to the 'cachot' (manacles 
on hands and feet, darkness, solitude, bread and water) only during 
the first stage of his imprisonment; he would be allowed to work 
first two then three days a week. After two thirds of his sentence 
had been served, he could pass to the 'gine' (a cell with light, chain 
around the waist, solitary work for five hours a day, but with other 
prisoners on the other two days; this work would be paid and would 
enable him to improve his daily fare). Lastly, when he approached 
the end of his sentence, he could pass to the normal prison regime: 
'lie will be allowed every day to meet other prisoners for work in 
common. If he prefers, he will be able to work alone. He will pay 
for his food from what he earns from his work'(Le Peletier, 3 *9-30). 

4. For the convict, the penalty is a mechanics of signs, interests 
and duration. But the guilty person is only one of the targets of 
punishment. For punishment is directed above all at others, at all 
the potentially guilty. So these obstacle-signs that are gradually 
engraved in the representation of the condemned man must there¬ 
fore circulate rapidly and widely; they must be accepted and redis¬ 
tributed by all; they must shape the discourse that each individual 
has with others and by which crime is forbidden to all by all - the 
true coin that is substituted in people’s minds for the false profits of 
crime. 


For this, everyone must see punishment not only as natural, but 
in his own interest; everyone must be able to read in it his own 
advantage. There must be no more spectacular, but useless penalties. 
There must be no secret penalties either; but punishment must be 
regarded as a retribution that the guilty man makes to each of his 
fellow citizens, for the crime that has wronged them all - penalties 
that are constantly placed before citizens’ eyes, and which ‘bring out 
the public utility of common and particular movements' (Dufriche 
de Valaze, 346). The ideal would be for the convict to appear as a 
sort of rentable property: a slave at the service of all. Why would 
society eliminate a life and a body that it could appropriate? It 
would be more useful to make him ‘serve the state in a slavery 
that would be more or less extended according to the nature of his 
crime’; France has all too many impracticable roads that impede 
trade; thieves who also obstruct die free circulation of goods could 
be put to rebuilding the highways. Far more telling than death 
would be ‘the example of a man who is ever before one’s eyes, whom 
one has deprived of liberty and who is forced to spend the rest of 
his days repairing the loss that he has caused society' (Boucher 
d'Argis, 1781, 139). 

In the old system, the body of the condemned man became the 
king's property, on which the sovereign left his mark and brought 
down the effects of his power. Now he will be rather the property 
of society, the object of a collective and useful appropriation. This 
explains why the reformers almost always proposed public works 
is one of the best possible penalties; in this, they were supported by 
the Cahiers de doUancer. ‘Let those condemned to penalties short of 
death be put to the public works of the country for a time propor¬ 
tionate to their crime.'* Public works meant two things: the collec¬ 
tive interest in the punishment of the condemend man and the 
visible, verifiable character of the punishment. Thus the convict 
pays twice; by the labour he provides and by the signs chat he 
produces. At the heart of society, on the public squares or highways, 
the convict is a focus of profit and signification. Visibly, he is 
serving everyone; but, at the same time, he lets slip into the minds 
of all the crime-punishment sign: a secondary, purely moral, but 
much more real utility. 

Hence a whole learned economy of publicity. In physical

torture, the example was based on terror: physical fear, collective 
horror, images that must be engraved on the memories of the specta¬ 
tors, like the brand on the cheek or shoulder of the condemned man. 
The example is now based on the lesson, the discourse, the decipher¬ 
able sign, the representation of public morality. It is no longer the 
terrifying restoration of sovereignty that will sustain the ceremony 
of punishment, but the reactivation of the code, the collective rein¬ 
forcements of the link between the idea of crime and the idea of 
punishment. In the penalty, rather than seeing the presence of the 
sovereign, one will read the laws themselves. The laws associated 
a particular crime with a particular punishment. As soon as the 
crime is committed, the punishment will follow at once, enacting the 
discourse of the law and showing that the code, which links ideas, 
also links realities. The junction, immediate in the text, must be 
immediate in acts. 'Consider those first movements in which the 
news of some horrible act spreads through our towns and country¬ 
side; the citizens arc like men who see lightning falling about them; 
everyone is moved by indignation and horror. . . That is the 
moment to punish the crime: do not let it slip by; hasten to prove 
it and judge it. Set up scaffolds, stakes, drag out the guilty man to 
the public squares, summon the people with great cries; you will 
then hear them applaud the proclamation of your judgements, as the 
proclamation of peace and liberty; you will sec them run to these 
terrible spectacles as to the triumph of the laws' (Servan, 

Public punishment is the ceremony of immediate recoding. 

The law is re-formed: it takes up its place on the side of the crime 
that violated it. The criminal, on the other hand, is detached from 
society, he leaves it. But not in those ambiguous festivals of the 
Ancicn Regime in which the people inevitably took part, either in 
the crime or in the execution, but in a ceremony of mourning. The 
society that has rediscovered its laws has lost the citizen who vio¬ 
lated them. Public punishment must manifest this double affliction: 
that a citizen should have been capable of ignoring the law and that 
one should have been obliged to separate oneself from a citizen. 
'Associate the scaffold with the most lugubrious and most moving 
ceremonies; let this terrible day be a day of mourning for the nation; 
let the general sorrow be painted everywhere in bold letters... Let 
the magistrate, wearing black, funereal crepe, announce the crime 


and the sad necessity of a legal vengeance to the people. Let the 
different scenes of this tragedy strike all the senses, stir all gentle, 
honest affections’ (Dufau, 688). 

The meaning of this mourning must be clear to all; each element 
of its ritual must speak, repeat the crime, recall the law, show the 
need for punishment and justify its degree. Posters, placards, signs, 
symbols must be distributed, so that everyone may learn their 
significations. The publicity of punishment must not have the 
physical effect of terror; it must open up a book to be read. Le 
Peletier suggested that, once a month, the people should be allowed 
to visit convicts, 'in their mournful cells: they will read, written in 
bold letters above the door, the name of the convict, his crime and 
his sentence’ (Le Peletier, 329-jo). And in the simple, military style 
of the imperial ceremonies, Bexon was to imagine some years later a 
whole tableau of penal heraldry: 'The prisoner condemned to death 
will be taken to the scaffold in a cart "hung or painted in black and 
red"; if he is a traitor, he will wear a red coat on which will be 
inscribed, in front and behind, the word "traitor"; if he is a parri¬ 
cide, his head will be covered with a black veil and on his shirt will 
be embroidered daggers or whatever instruments of death he used; 
if he is a poisoner, his red shirt will be decorated with snakes and 
other venomous animals' (Bexon, 24-5 - this project was presented 
to the King of Bavaria). 

This legible lesson, this ritual recoding, must be repeated as often 
as possible; the punishments must be a school rather than a festival; 
an ever-open book rather than a ceremony. The duration that makes 
the punishment effective for the guilty is also useful for the specta¬ 
tors. They must be able to consult at each moment the permanent 
lexicon of crime and punishment. A secret punishment is a punish¬ 
ment half wasted. Children should be allowed to come to the places 
where the penalty is being carried out; there they will attend their 
classes in civics. And grown men will periodically relearn the laws. 
Let us conceive of places of punishment as a Garden of the Laws 
ihat families would visit on Sundays. 'I propose that, from time to 
time, after preparing people’s minds with a reasoned discourse on 
the preservation of the social order, on the utility of punishment, 
men as well as boys should be taken to the mines and to the work 
camps and contemplate the frightful fate of these outlaw's. Such

l iMlny ol'punishment was one of the fundamental principles of the 
i...« penal code: ‘Often, at certain special times, the presence of 
11 i | • I ip|c must bring down shame upon the heads of the guilty; and 
iii pii .nice of the guilty person in the pitiful state to which his crime 
I i i educed him must bring useful instruction to the souls of the 
,. pie' (Le Peletier, 321). Long before he was regarded as an object 
id m icncc, the criminal was imagined as a source of instruction.

fi. This will make possible in society an inversion of the tradi¬ 
tional discourse of crime. How can one extinguish the dubious glory 
of the criminal? This was a matter of grave concern to the law¬ 
makers of the eighteenth century. How can one silence the adven¬ 
tures of the great criminals celebrated in the almanacs, broadsheets 
and popular talcs? If the recoding of punishment is well done, if the 
ceremony of mourning takes place as it should, the crime can no 
longer appear as anything but a misfortune and the criminal as an 
enemy who must be re-educated into social life. Instead of those 
songs of praise that turn the criminal into a hero, only those 
obstacle-signs that arrest the desire to commit the crime by the 
calculated fear of punishment will circulate in men’s discourse. The 
positive mechanics will operate to the full in the language of every 
day, which will constantly reinforce it with new- accounts. Discourse 
will become rite vehicle of the law: the constant principle of uni¬ 
versal recoding. The poets of the people will at last join those who 
call themselves the ’missionaries of eternal reason’; they will become 
moralists. ‘Filled with these terrible images and salutary ideas, each 
citizen will spread them through his family and there, by long 
accounts delivered with as much fervour as they are avidly listened 
to, his children gathered around him, will open up their young 
memories to receive, in imperishable lineaments, the notion of 
crime and punishment, the love of law and country, the respect and 
trust of the magistrature. Country people, too, will be witnesses ol

these examples and will sow them around their huts, the taste of 
virtue will take root in these coarse souls, while the evil-doer, dis¬ 
mayed at the public joy, fearful at the sight of so many enemies, 
may abandon plans whose outcome will be as prompt as it is 
gloomy' (Servan, 37). 

This, then, is how one must imagine the punitive city. At the 
crossroads, in the gardens, at the side of roads being repaired or 
bridges built, in workshops open to all, in the depths of mines that 
may be visited, will be hundreds of tiny theatres of punishment. 
Each crime will have its law; each criminal his punishment. It will 
be a visible punishment, a punishment that tells all, that explains, 
justifies itself, convicts: placards, different-coloured caps bearing 
inscriptions, posters, symbols, texts read or printed, tirelessly repeat 
the code. Scenery, perspectives, optical effects, trompt-l'ail some¬ 
times magnify the scene, making it more fearful than it is, but also 
clearer. From where the public is sitting, it is possible to believe in 
the existence of certain cruelties which, in fact, do not take place. 
But the essential point, in all these real or magnified severities, is 
•hat they should all, according to a strict economy, teach a lesson: 
that each punishment should be a fable. And that, in counterpoint 
with all the direct examples of virtue, one may at each moment 
rncounter, as a living spectacle, the misfortunes of vice. Around 
**ach of these moral 'representations’, schoolchildren will gather 
with their masters and adults will learn what lessons to teach their 
offspring. The great terrifying ritual of the public execution gives 
way, day after day, street after street, to this serious theatre, with its 
multifarous and persuasive scenes. And popular memory will 
reproduce in rumour the austere discourse of the law. But perhaps 
tt will be necessary, above these innumerable spectacles and narra¬ 
tives, to place the major sign of punishment for the most terrible 
of crimes: the keystone of the penal edifice. In any case, Vermeil had 
imagined the scene of absolute punishment that should dominate all 
the theatres of everyday punishment: the only case in which one 
had to seek to reach an infinity of punishment, something equivalent 
in the new penal system to what regicide had been in the old. The 
nun found guilty of this crime would have his eyes put out; he 
would be put into an iron cage, suspended in the air, above a public 
•quare; he would be completely naked; he would be attached to the 


Punishment 


bars of the cage by an iron belt around his waist; to the end of his 
days, he would be fed on bread and water. ‘Thus he would be 
exposed to all the rigours of the seasons, sometimes his head would 
be covered with snow, sometimes burnt by a scorching sun. It is 
in this energetic torture, presenting rather the extension of a painful 
death than that of a painful life, that one would truly recognize a 
villain deserving of the horror of nature in its entirety, condemned 
to sec no longer the heaven that he has outraged and to live no 
longer on the earth that he has sullied’ (Vermeil, 148-9). Above the 
punitive city hangs this iron spider; and the criminal who is to be 
thus crucified by the new law is the parricide. 

There is a whole new arsenal of picturesque punishments. 'Avoid 
inflicting the same punishments,' said Mably. The idea of a uniform 
penalty, modulated only according to the gravity of the crime is 
banished. To be more precise: the use of imprisonment as a general 
form of punishment is never presented in these projects for specific, 
visible and 'telling' penalties. Imprisonment is envisaged, but as one 
among other penalties; it is the specific punishment for certain 
offences, those that infringe the liberty of individuals (such as 
abduction) or those that result from an abuse of liberty (disorder, 
violence). It is also envisaged as a condition to enable certain 
punishments to be carried out (forced labour, for example). But it 
docs not cover the whole field of penality with its duration as the 
sole principle of variation. Or rather, the idea of penal imprison¬ 
ment is explicitly criticized by many reformers. Because it is 
incapable of corresponding to the specificity of crimes. Because it 
has no effect on the public. Because it is useless, even harmful, to 
society: it is costly, it maintains convicts in idleness, it multiplies 
their vices (cf. Archives parlementaires , XXVI, 712). Because the 
execution of such a penalty is difficult to supervise and because there 
is a risk of exposing prisoners to the arbitrary will of their guards. 
Because the job of depriving a man of his liberty and of supervising 
him is an exercise of tyranny. ‘You are demanding that there should 
be monsters among you; and if these odious men existed, the legisla¬ 
tor ought perhaps to treat them as murderers' (Mably, 338). Prison 
as the universal penalty is incompatible with this whole technique 
of penalty-effect, penalty-representation, penalty-general function, 


114 


The gentle way in punishment 


penalty-sign and discourse. It is obscurity, violence and suspicion. 
'It is a place of darkness in which the citizen’s eye cannot count the 
victims, in which consequently their number is lost as an example. 
... Whereas if, without multiplying crimes, one could multiply the 
example of punishments, one would succeed at last in rendering 
them less necessary; indeed, the obscurity of the prisons becomes 
a subject ol defiance for the citizens; they easily suppose that great 
injustices are committed there. . . There is certainly something 
wrong when the law, which is made for the good of the multitude, 
instead of arousing its gratitude, continually arouses its discontent' 
(Dufriche de Valaze, 344-5). 

The idea that imprisonment might as it docs today cover the 
whole middle ground of punishment, between death and light 
penalties, was one that the reformers could not arrive at immediately. 

The problem is the following: within a short space of time, 
detention became the essential form of punishment. In the penal 
code of 1810, between death and fines, it occupies, in a number of 
forms, almost the whole field of possible punishments. 'What is the 
system of penality accepted by the new law? It is incarceration in all 
its forms. Indeed, compare the four principal penalties that remain 
in the penal code. Forced labour is a form of incarceration. The 
convict-ship is an open-air prison. Detention, reclusion, imprison¬ 
ment for a minor offence are in a sense merely different names for 
one and the same punishment’ (Rimusat, 185). And the Empire 
decided at once to translate this imprisonment, envisaged by the 
law, into reality, according to a whole penal, administrative, geo¬ 
graphical hierarchy; at the lowest degree, associated with each 
justice of the peace, municipal maisons de police ; in each arrondissc- 
ment, maisons d'arrfr, in each departement, a maison de correction; 
at the summit, several maisons centrales for convicted criminals or 
iorrectionels serving sentences of over one year; lastly, in a few ports, 
convict-ships. A great prison structure was planned, whose different 
levels would correspond exactly to the levels of the centralized 
administration. The scaffold, where the body of the tortured 
criminal had been exposed to the ritually manifested force of the 
sovereign, the punitive theatre in which the representation of 
punishment was permanently available to the social body, was 
icplaced by a great enclosed, complex and hierarchized structure 



Punishment

that was integrated into the very body of the state apparatus. A 
quite different materiality, a quite different physics of power, a quite 
different way of investing men's bodies had emerged. During the 
Restoration and the July monarchy, there were, apart from a few 
exceptional moments, between 40,000 and 43,000 prisoners in 
French gaols (approximately one prisoner per 600 inhabitants). 
The high wall, no longer the wall that surrounds and protects, no 
longer the wall that stands for power and wealth, but the meticu¬ 
lously sealed wall, uncrossable in either direction, closed in upon the 
now mysterious work of punishment, will become, near at hand, 
sometimes even at the very centre of the cities of the nineteenth 
century, the monotonous figure, at once material and symbolic, of 
the power to punish. Already under the Consulate, the Minister of 
the Interior had been appointed to investigate the different ‘places 
of safety’ that were already functioning and which could be used in 
different towns. A few years later, sums had been allocated for the 
construction, in keeping with the power that they were to represent 
and serve, of these new castles of the new civil order. The empire 
used them in fact, for another war (cf. Decazes). A less extravagant, 
but more obstinate economy continued to build them throughout 
the nineteenth century. 

In under twenty years, in any case, the principle so clearly 
formulated in the Constituent Assembly, of specific, appropriate, 
effective penalties, constituting, in each case, a lesson for all, became 
the law of detention for every offence of any importance, except 
those requiring the death penalty. The theatre of punishment of 
which the eighteenth century dreamed and which would have acted 
essentially on the minds of the general public was replaced by the 
great uniform machinery of the prisons, whose network of immense 
buildings was to extend across France and Europe. But twenty years 
is perhaps too long a chronology for this conjuring trick. It may 
be argued that it occurred almost instantaneously. One has only to 
look at the bill for the criminal code presented in the Constituent 
Assembly by Le Peletier. The principle stated at the outset is the 
need for ‘exact relations between the nature of the offence and the 
nature of the punishment': physical pain should be inflicted on those 
who commit crimes of violence, hard labour on the idle, shame on 
those with degraded souls. But the severe penalties actually 


116 



proposed are three forms of detention: the ‘cachot\ in which the 
penalty of imprisonment is augmented by various measures (solitude, 
a deprivation of light, restrictions on food); th c'gent y in which these 
ancillary measures are attenuated, and lastly imprisonment proper, 
which is reduced to simple confinement. The diversity, so solemnly 
promised, is reduced in the end to this grey, uniform penalty. 
Indeed, at the time, there were deputies who expressed surprise that, 
instead of establishing a natural relation between offences and 
penalties, a quite different plan had been adopted: 'So that if I have 
betrayed my country, I go to prison; if I have killed my father, I go 
to prison; every imaginable offence is punished in the same uniform 
way. One might as well see a physician who has the same remedy 
for all ills' (Chabroud, 618). 

This prompt substitution was not confined to France. It was to be 
found, to a greater or lesser degree, in other countries. When 
Catherine II, in the years immediately following the treatise Da 
diliu a da peina , gave instructions to the commission entrusted 
with the task of drawing up a 'new code of laws', Bcccaria's lesson 
on the specificity and variety of penalties was not forgotten; it was 
repeated almost word for word: 'It is a triumph of civil liberty when 
the criminal laws derive each penalty from the particular nature of 
each crime. In this way all arbitrariness ceases; the penalty docs not 
depend on the caprice of the legislator, but on the nature of the 
thing; it is not man who does violence to man, but the man’s own 
action’ (article 67). A few years later, Beccaria’s general principle 
terved as a foundation for the new Tuscan Code and for the new 
code given by Joseph II to Austria; and yet both legislations made 
imprisonment - modulated according to its duration and aug¬ 
mented in certain cases by branding or the use of irons - an almost 
uniform penalty: at least thirty years’ detention for an attempt on 
the sovereign's life, for counterfeiting and for murder with robbery; 
fifteen to thirty years for voluntary homicide or armed robbery; one 
month to five years for simple theft, etc. 1 

But if this colonization of the penalty by the prison is surprising, 
it is because imprisonment was not, as one might imagine, a punish¬ 
ment that was already securely established in the penal system, just 
Ix-low the death penalty, and which naturally occupied the place left 
vjeant by the disappearance of public torture. In fact, imprisonment 


1 *7 







Punishment 


- and on this point many countries were in the same situation as 
France - had only a limited and marginal position in the system of 
penalties. This is shown by the texts themselves. The ordinance of 
1670 does not include detention among the panes afflictives, or 
serious penalties. Perpetual or temporary imprisonment was no 
doubt included among certain local customs and practices (cf., for 
example, Coquille). But contemporary writers maintained that it was 
falling into disuse together with other forms of torture: 'There were 
formerly penalties that are no longer practised in France, such as 
writing a condemned man’s penalty on his face or forehead and 
perpetual imprisonment, just as one no longer condemns a criminal 
to be exposed to wild beasts or sent down the mines' (Rousseaud de 
la Combe, 3). In fact, it is certain that imprisonment had survived 
tenaciously as a punishment for less serious offences, according to 
local customs and practices. In this sense, Soulatges spoke of the 
'light penalties’ that the ordinance of 1670 had not mentioned: 
reprimand, admonition, banishment from a certain place, satisfaction 
to the injured party and a term of imprisonment. In certain regions, 
especially those that had most preserved their legal peculiarities, the 
penalty of imprisonment was still widespread, but this had its 
difficulties, as in the recently annexed province of Roussillon. 

Yet, despite these divergencies, jurists held firmly to the principle 
that 'imprisonment is not to be regarded as a penalty in our civil 
law' (Scrpillon, 1095 - however, one docs find in Serpillon the idea 
that the rigour of imprisonment is the beginning of a penalty). Its 
role is rather that of holding the person and his body as security: 
ad continendos homines , non ad puniendos, as the tag has it; in this 
sense, the imprisonment of a suspect has a role similar to that of a 
debtor. Through imprisonment, one has security for someone, one 
does not punish him. 4 This was the general principle. And although 
imprisonment sometimes served as a penalty, even in important 
cases, it did so essentially as a substitute: it replaced the galleys for 
those - women, children, invalids - who could not serve there: ‘The 
sentence of imprisonment for a term or for life is equivalent to being 
sent to the galleys.’ 6 In this equivalence, one can sec clearly enough 
the emergence of a possible connection. But, for this to take place, 
the prison had to change its juridical status. 

It was also necessary to overcome a second obstacle, which, for 


118 


The gentle way in punishment 


France at least, was a considerable one. Imprisonment was especially 
disqualified for this role by the fact that it was, in practice, directly 
bound up with arbitrary royal decision and the excesses of the 
sovereign power. The 'maisons de force', the general hospitals, the 
'king's orders’ or the orders of the police magistrates, letters under 
the king’s private seal obtained by notables or by families, con¬ 
stituted a whole repressive practice, juxtaposed with 'regular justice’ 
and more usually opposed to it. And this extra-judicial imprison¬ 
ment came to be rejected by both classical jurists and reformers. 
Prisons are made by princes, said a traditionalist like Serpillon, who 
sheltered behind the authority of Judge Bouhier: 'Although, for 
reasons of state, princes are sometimes inclined to inflict this penalty, 
ordinary justice makes no use of this kind of sentence’ (Serpillon, 
1091). Detention was described by the reformers in innumerable 
statements as a figure and privileged instrument of despotism: 'What 
is one to say of those secret prisons conjured up by the fatal spirit of 
monarchism, reserved in the main either for philosophers, in whose 
hands nature has placed her torch and who dared to enlighten their 
century, or for those proud independent souls who lack the coward¬ 
ice to keep silent on the ills of their country; prisons whose gloomy 

I doors are opened by mysterious letters and swallow up forever its 
unfortunate victims? What is to be said even of those letters, those 
masterpieces of ingenious tyranny, which overthrow the privilege 
»»f every citizen to be heard before he is judged, and which are a 
thousand times more dangerous for men than the invention of 
I'halaris .. (Brissot, 173). 

No doubt these protests, coming from such diverse sources, are 
directed not at imprisonment as a legal penalty, but at the 'illegal' 

I ' arbitrary’, indeterminate detention. Nevertheless, imprison- 
ivas seen, generally speaking, as branded by the abuses of 
. And many cahiers de dolcances rejected it as incompatible 
'ood justice. Sometimes in the name of classical juridical

family; it was said that ‘imprisonment is not a penalty. Humanit} 
rises up against the frightful thought that it is not a punishment t.. 
deprive a citizen of his most precious possession, to plunge him 
ignominiously into the den of crime, to snatch him from everything 
that is dear to him, to bring him perhaps to ruin and to deprive not 
only him but his unfortunate family of all means of subsistence’ 
(Desjardin, 483). And, on several occasions, the caliers demanded 
the abolition of those ‘houses of internment’: 'We believe that the 
maisons de force must be razed to the ground. . .' 7 And the decrcr 
of 13 March 1790 ordered the freeing of ‘all persons detained in 
castles, religious houses, maisons de force , maisons de police or any 
other prisons, by orders under the king's private seal or by orders 
of the agents of the executive power'. 

How then could detention, so evidently bound up with an 
illegality that was denounced even in the power of the prince, 
become in so short a time one of the most general forms of legal 
punishment? 


The explanation most usually given is the formation, during the 
classical age, of a number of great models of punitive imprisonment 
Their prestige, which was all the greater in that the most recent 
examples came from England and above all from America, appears 
to have made it possible to overcome the double obstacle constituted 
by the age-old rules of law and the despotic functioning of im¬ 
prisonment. Very soon, it seems, these obstacles were swept away 
by the punitive marvels thought up by the reformers, and detention 
became a serious reality. There can be no doubt about the importance 
of these models. But it is precisely these models that, before pro¬ 
viding a solution, themselves pose problems: the problem of their 
existence and the problem of their diffusion. How were they able 
to come into being and, above all, how did they become so generally 
accepted? For it is easy to show that, although they correspond on a 
number of points with the general principles of penal reform, they 
fail to do so on an even greater number; sometimes they are even 
quite incompatible. 

The oldest of these models, the one that is generally regarded 41 
having more or less inspired all the others, was the Rasphuis ol 
Amsterdam, opened in 1596. 8 Originally, it was intended for 


The gentle way in punishment 


i-rggars or young malefactors. Its functioning obeyed three great 
(•rinciples: the duration of the penalties could, at least within 
* Ttain limits, be determined by the administration itself, according 
10 the prisoner’s conduct (indeed this latitude could be given in the 
»cntence itself: in 1597 a prisoner was condemned to twelve years’ 
imprisonment, which could be reduced to eight, if his behaviour 
proved satisfactory). Work was obligatory; it was performed in 
common (indeed the individual cell was used only as an additional 
punishment; prisoners slept two or three to a bed, in cells containing 
lietween four and twelve persons); and, for the work done, the 
prisoners received wages. A strict time-table, a system of prohibi¬ 
tions and obligations, continual supervision, exhortations, religious 

I s, a whole complex of methods ‘to draw towards good’ and 
away from evil' held the prisoners in its grip from day to 
ne may take the Rasphuis of Amsterdam as a basic figure, 
ally, it forms the link between the theory, so characteristic 
ixteenth century, of a pedagogical and spiritual transforma- 
individuals brought about by continuous exercise, and the 
tiary techniques conceived in the second half of the eighteenth 
. And it provided die three institutions that were then set up 
e fundamental principles that each was to develop in its own 
ar direction. 

maison de force at Ghent organized penal labour above all 
economic imperatives. The reason given was that idleness 
: general cause of most crimes. An investigation - no doubt 
the first - carried out among those sentenced under the 
tion of Alost, in 1749, showed that malefactors were not 
s or labourers' (workers think only of the work that feeds 
but 'idlers given up to begging'.* Hence the idea of a house 
)uld in a sense provide a universal pedagogy of work for 
'ho had proved to be resistant to it. This had four advantages: 
red the number of criminal prosecutions, which were costly 
state (it was estimated that this would save over 100,000 
; in Flanders); this would make it unnecessary to return 
paid in taxes to the owners of woods ruined by vagabonds; 
d create a mass of new workers, which would help 'by com- 
1 to bring down the cost of labour’; lastly, it would enable the 
or to benefit, to the full, from necessary charity (Vilan, 68). 



Punishment 


This useful pedagogy would revive for the lazy individual a liking 
for work, force him back into a system of interests in which labour 
would be more advantageous than laziness, form around him a 
small, miniature, simplified, coercive society in which the maxim, 
‘he who wants to live must work’, would be clearly revealed. Work 
would be compulsory', but so too would be remuneration, which 
enables the prisoner to improve his lot during and after detention. 
'The man who does not find his subsistence must be made to desire 
to procure it for himself by work; he is offered it by supervision and 
discipline; in a sense, he is forced to acquire it; he is then tempted 
by the bait of gain; corrected in his morals, accustomed to work, 
his anxiety aroused by the little money he has kept for his release,’ 
he has learned a trade 'that will guarantee a subsistence without 
danger’ (Vilan, 107). This reconstruction of homo otconomicus ex¬ 
cluded the use of penalties that were too short - this would prevent 
the acquisition of habits and skills of work - or too long - which 
would make any apprenticeship useless. 'The term of six months 
is too short to correct criminals, and to bring them to the spirit of 
work’; on the other hand, 'a life sentence throws them into despair; 
they become indifferent to the correction of their morals and to the 
spirit of work; they become concerned only with plans to escape 
and to rebel; and since the judgements that were passed on them 
did not deprive them of life, why should one seek to render it 
unbearable for them?’ (Vilan, 102-3). The duration of the penalty 
has meaning only in relation to possible correction, and to an 
economic use of the corrected criminal. 

To the principle of work, the English models added, as an 
essential addition to correction, isolation. The outlines had been 
provided in 1775, by Hanway, who justified it first with negative 
reasons: promiscuity in the prison provided bad examples and possi¬ 
bilities of escape in the short term and of blackmail or complicity in 
the long term. The prison would be too much like a factory if one 
left the prisoners to work together. The positive reasons followed: 
isolation provides a ‘terrible shock’ which, while protecting the 
prisoner from bad influences, enables him to go into himself and 
rediscover in the depths of his conscience the voice of good; solitary 
work would then become not only an apprenticeship, but also an exer¬ 
cise in spiritual conversion; it would rearrange not only the complex

of interests proper to homo otconomicus , but also the imperatives of 
the moral subject. The cell, that technique of Christian monachism, 
which had survived only in Catholic countries, becomes in this 
protestant society the instrument by which one may reconstitute 
both homo otconomicus and the religious conscience. Between the 
crime and the return to right and virtue, the prison would constitute 
the ‘space between two worlds’ the place for the individual transfor¬ 
mation that would restore to the state the subject it had lost. Hanway 
called this apparatus for modifying individuals a ‘reformatory’ (cf. 
Hanway). These were the general principles that Howard and 
Blackstone put into operation in 1779 when the independence of the 
United States put an end to deportation and when a law was being 
drawn up to modify the system of penalties. Imprisonment, with the 
purpose of transforming the soul and conduct, made its entry into 
the system of civil laws. The preamble of the bill, written by Black- 
stone and Howard, describes individual imprisonment in terms of 
its triple function as example to be feared, instrument of conversion 
and condition for an apprenticeship: subjected 'to isolated detention, 
regular work and the influence of religious instruction’, certain 
criminals might not only inspire terror in those who would be 
tempted to imitate them, ’but also to correct themselves and to 
acquire the habit of work’ (Preamble of the bill of 1779)- Hence the 
decision to build two penitentiaries, one for men, one for women, 
in which the isolated prisoners would be put 'to the most servile 
labours, most compatible with the ignorance, negligence and 
obstinacy of the criminals': walking in a wheel to move a machine, 
fixing a winch, polishing marble, beating hemp, rasping logwood, 
cutting up rags, rope-making and sewing sacks. In fact, only one 
penitentiary was built, at Gloucester, and it corresponded only 
partially to the initial plan: total confinement for the most dangerous 
criminals; for the others, day work in common and separation at 
night. 

Then came the Philadelphia model. This was no doubt the most 
famous because it was associated in people’s minds with the political 
innovations of the American system and also because it was not, 
like the others, doomed to immediate failure and abandonment; it 
was continuously re-examined and transformed right up to the 
^rcat debates of the 1830s on penitentiary reform. In many respects

Punishment 


The gentle way in punishment 


the Walnut Street Prison, opened in 1790, under the direct influence 
of the Quakers, was modelled on those of Ghent and Gloucester. 10 
There was compulsory work in workshops; the prisoners were kept 
constantly occupied; the prison was financed by this work, but the 
prisoners were also rewarded individually as a way of reinserting 
them morally and materially into the strict world of the economy; 
by keeping the prisoners 'constantly employed on productive 
works, they were able to defray the expenses of the prison, they 
were not left idle and they were able to save a little money for the 
time when their captivity would cease' (La Rochefoucauld-Lian- 
court, 9). Life was partitioned, therefore, according to an absolutely 
strict time-table, under constant supervision; each moment of the 
day was devoted to a particular type of activity, and brought with it 
its own obligations and prohibitions: 'All prisoners rise at daybreak, 
so that, after making their beds, cleaning and washing themselves 
and attending to other needs, they generally begin their work at 
sunrise. From that moment, no one may go into the rooms or other 
places except to the workshops and places assigned for their work. 
... At nightfall, a bell rings to mark the end of their work... They 
arc given half an hour to arrange their beds, after which they are not 
allowed to converse aloud or to make the least noise' (Turnbull, 15- 
16). As at Gloucester, solitary confinement was not total; it was used 
for certain prisoners who would in former times have incurred the 
death penalty, and for those inside the prison who deserved special 
punishment: 'There, without occupation, without anything to dis¬ 
tract him, waiting in uncertainty for the moment when he would be 
delivered', the prisoner spent 'long anxious hours, with nothing but 
the reflections that arc present to the minds of all guilty persons’ 
(Teeters, 1935, 49). Lastly, as at Ghent, the length of the imprison¬ 
ment could vary with the behaviour of the prisoner after consulting 
the files, the prison inspectors obtained from the authorities - with¬ 
out much difficulty up to the 1820s - pardons for prisoners who had 
shown good behaviour. 

Furthermore, Walnut Street had a number of characteristics that 
were specific to it, or which at least developed what was potentially 
present in the other models. First, the principle of not publicizing 
the penalty. Though the sentence and the reasons for it should be 
known to all, the penalty should be carried out in secret; the public 




was to intervene neither as a witness, nor as a guarantor of punish¬ 
ment; the certainty that, behind the walls, the prisoner was serving 
his sentence must suffice as an example: there were to be no more 
of those street spectacles which the law' of 1786 has given rise to by 
impesing on certain prisoners public works to be carried out in 
towns and on the highways. 11 The punishment and correction that 
it must operate are processes that unfold betw-een the prisoner and 
those who supervise him. They are processes that effect a transforma¬ 
tion of the individual as a whole - of his body and of his habits by 
the daily work that he is forced to perform, of his mind and his will 
by the spiritual attentions that arc paid to him: ‘Bibles and other 
books of religious practice arc provided; the clergy of the different 
obediences to be found in the town and suburbs perform the services 
once a week and any other edifying person may have access to the 
prisoners at any time' (Teeters, 1935, 53-4)- But this transformation 
is entrusted to the administration itself. Solitude and self-examina¬ 
tion are not enough; nor are purely religious exhortations. Work on 
the prisoner's soul must be carried out as often as possible. The 
prison, though an administrative apparatus, will at the same time be 
a machine for altering minds. On first entering the prison, the 
prisoner will be read the regulations; 'at the same time, the inspectors 
seek to strengthen in him the moral obligations that he now has; 
they represent to him the offence that he has committed with regard 
to them, the evil that has consequently resulted for the society that 
protected him and the need to make compensation by his example 
and his amendment. They then make him promise to do his duty 
gladly, to behave decently, promising him or allow ing him to hope 
that, before the expiration of the term of the sentence, he will be 
able to obtain his discharge if he behaves well. . . From time to 
time the inspectors make it their duty to converse with the criminals 
one after the other, concerning their duties as men and as members 
of society’’ (Turnbull, 27). 

But no doubt the most important thing was that this control and 
transformation of behaviour were accompanied - both as a condition 
and as a consequence - by the development of a knowledge of the 
individuals. When the new prisoner arrived, the Walnut Street 
administration received a report concerning his crime, the circum¬ 
stances in which it was committed, a summary of the examinations 






Punishment 


of the defendant, notes on his behaviour before and after sentence: 
indispensable elements if one wished to ‘decide what steps will have 
to be taken to destroy his old habits'. 12 And throughout his deten¬ 
tion he would be observed; his conduct would be noted daily and 
the inspectors - twelve local worthies appointed in 1795 - who, two 
by two, visited the prison each week, would be kept informed of 
events, follow the conduct of each prisoner and decide which of 
them deserved a shortening of his term. This ever-growing know¬ 
ledge of the individuals made it possible to divide them up in the 
prison not so much according to their crimes as according to the 
dispositions that they revealed. The prison became a sort of permanent 
observatory that made it possible to distribute the varieties of vice 
or weakness. From 1797, the prisoners were divided into four classes: 
the first for those who were explicitly condemned to solitary con¬ 
finement or who had committed serious offences in the prison; the 
second for those who were 'well known as old offenders ... whose 
depraved morality, dangerous character, irregular dispositions, or 
disorderly conduct' became apparent during the time they were in 
prison; the third for those 'whose character and circumstances, 
before and after conviction, led one to believe that they were not 
habitual offenders'; the fourth and last was a special section, a 
probationary class for those whose character was still not known, 
or who, if they were better known, did not deserve to be put in the 
preceding category (Teeters, 19)5, 59). A whole corpus of indivi¬ 
dualizing knowledge was being organized that took as its field of 
reference not so much the crime committed (at least in isolation), 
but the potentiality of danger that lies hidden in an individual and 
which is manifested in his observed everyday conduct. The prison 
functions in this as an apparatus of knowledge. 

Between this apparatus of punishment proposed by the Flemish, 
English and American models, between these ‘reformatories' and 
all the punishments imagined by the reformers, one may establish 
the points of convergence and the disparities. 

Points of convergence. In the first instance, there is a difference 
in the temporal direction of punishment. The 'reformatories’ were 
mechanisms directed towards the future; they too were intended not 
to efface a crime, but to prevent its repetition. ‘As to the ent/, or 


126 


The gentle way in punishment 


final cause of human punishments. This is not by way of atonement 
or expiation for the crime committed; for that must be left to the just 
determination of the supreme being —' (Blackstone, 11). And in 
Pennsylvania, Buxton declared, the principles of Montesquieu and 
Beccaria should now have the 'force of axioms', that ‘the prevention 
of crimes is the sole end of punishment' (Bradford, 3). So one 
punishes not to efface the crime, but to transform a criminal (actual 
or potential); punishment must bring with it a certain corrective 
technique. Here, too. Rush is close to the reforming jurists - were 
it not, perhaps, for the metaphor he uses when he says: we have 
invented machines that facilitate labour; how much more one should 
praise the inventor of 'the most speedy and effectual methods of 
restoring the vicious part of mankind to virtue and happiness, and of 
extirpating a portion of vice from the world’. 1 * Lastly, the English 
and the American models, like the projects of the legislators and 
theoreticians, require methods to individualize the penalty: in its 
duration, its nature, its intensity, the way in w-hich it is carried out, 
the punishment must be adjusted to the individual character and to 
the danger that he bears within him for others. The system of 
penalties must be open to individual variables. In their general out¬ 
line, the models more or less inspired by the Rasphuis of Amsterdam 
w’ere not in contradiction with the proposals of the reformers. It 
might even be thought at first glance that they were merely a devel¬ 
opment of them - or a sketch - at the level of concrete institutions. 

Yet the disparity emerges clearly enough when one defines the 
techniques of this individualizing correction. The difference is 
to be found in the procedure of access to the individual, the way in 
which the punishing power gets control over him, the instruments 
that it uses in order to achieve this transformation; it is in the 
technology of the penalty, not in its theoretical foundation; in the 
relation that it establishes with the body and with the soul, and not 
in the way that it is inserted within the legal system. 

That was the method of the reformers. Where exactly did the 
penalty apply its pressure, gain control of the individual? Represen¬ 
tations: the representations of his interests, the representation of his 
advantages and disadvantages, pleasure and displeasure; and, if the 
punishment happens to seize the body, to apply techniques to it that 
are little short of torture, it is because it is - for the condemned man 


127 



Punishment

and for the spectators - an object of representation. By what instru¬ 
ment did one act on the representations? Other representations, or 
rather couplings of ideas (crime-punishment, the imagined advan¬ 
tage of crime-disadvantage perceived in the punishments); these 
pairings could function only in the element of publicity: punitive 
scenes that established them or reinforced them in the eyes of all, a 
discourse that circulated, brought back into currency at each 
moment the complex of signs. The role of the criminal in punish¬ 
ment was to reintroduce, in the face of crime and the criminal code, 
the real presence of the signified - that is to say, of the penalty 
which, according to the terms of the code, must be infallibly associ¬ 
ated with the offence. By producing this signified abundantly and 
visibly, and therefore reactivating the signifying system of the code, 
the idea of crime functioning as a sign of punishment, it is with this 
coin that the offender pays his debt to society. Individual correction 
must, therefore, assure the process of redefining the individual as 
subject of law, through the reinforcement of the systems of signs 
and representations that they circulate. 

The apparatus of corrective penality acts in a quite different way. 
The point of application of the penalty is not the representation, but 
the body, time, everyday gestures and activities; the soul, too, but 
in so far as it is the seat of habits. The body and the soul, as prin¬ 
ciples of behaviour, form the clement that is now proposed for 
punitive intervention. Rather than on an art of representations, this 
punitive intervention must rest on a studied manipulation of the 
individual: 'I have no more doubt of every crime having its cure in 
moral and physical influence ...'; so, in order to decide on punish¬ 
ments, one ‘will require some knowledge of the principles of sensa¬ 
tion, and of the sympathies which occur in .the nervous system' 
(Rush, 13). As for the instruments used, these are no longer com¬ 
plexes of representation, reinforced and circulated, but forms of 
coercion, schemata of constraint, applied and repeated. Exercises, 
not signs: time-tables, compulsory movements, regular activities, 
solitary meditation, work in common, silence, application, respect, 
good habits. And, ultimately, what one is trying to restore in this 
technique of correction is not so much the juridical subject, who is 
caught up in the fundamental interests of the social pact, but the 
obedient subject, the individual subjected to habits, rules, orders, 


an authority that is exercised continually around him and upon 
him, and which he must allow to function automatically in him. 
There are two quite distinct ways, therefore, of reacting to the 
offence: one may restore the juridical subject of the social pact, or 
shape an obedient subject, according to the general and detailed 
form of some power. 

All this would no doubt amount to little more than a speculative 
difference - for in each case it is a question of forming obedient 
individuals - if the penality of 'coercion' did not bring with it 
certain crucial consequences. The training of behaviour by a full 
time-table, the acquisition of habits, the constraints of the body 
imply a very special relation between the individual who is punished 
and the individual who punishes him. It is a relation that not only 
renders the dimension of the spectacle useless: it excludes it. 14 The 
agent of punishment must exercise a total power, which no third 
party can disturb; the individual to be corrected must be entirely 
enveloped in the power that is being exercised over him. Secrecy is 
imperative, and so too is autonomy, at least in relation to this 
technique of punishment: it must have its own functioning, its own 
rules, its own techniques, its own knowledge; it must fix its own 
norms, decide its own results. There is a discontinuity, or in any 
case a specificity, in relation to the legal power that declares guilt 
and fixes the general limits of punishment. These two consequences 

secrecy and autonomy in the exercise of the power to punish - arc 
unacceptable for a theory and a policy of penality that has two aims 
in view: to get all citizens to participate in the punishment of the 
social enemy and to render the exercise of the power to punish 
entirely adequate and transparent to the laws that publicly define it. 
Secret punishments and punishments not specified in the legal code, 
□ power to punish exercised in the shadows according to criteria and 
with instruments that elude control - this was enough to compro¬ 
mise the whole strategy of the reform. After the sentence, a power 
was constituted that was reminiscent of the power exercised in the 
old system. The power that applied the penalties now- threatened 
to be as arbitrary, as despotic, as the power that once decided them. 

In short, the divergence is the follow-ing: punitive city or coercive 
institution? On the one hand, a functioning of penal power, dis¬ 
tributed throughout the social space; present everywhere as scene, 


Punishment

spectacle, sign, discourse; legible like an open book; operating by a 
permanent recodification of the mind of the citizens; eliminating 
crime by those obstacles placed before the idea of crime; acting 
invisibly and uselessly on the ‘soft fibres of the brain’, as Servan put 
it. A power to punish that ran the whole length of the social network 
would act at each of its points, and in the end would no longer be 
perceived as a power of certain individuals over others, but as an 
immediate reaction of all in relation to the individual. On the other 
hand, a compact functioning of the power to punish: a meticulous 
assumption of responsibility for the body and the time of the con¬ 
vict, a regulation of his movements and behaviour by a system of 
authority and knowledge; a concerted orthopaedy applied to con¬ 
victs in order to reclaim them individually; an autonomous adminis¬ 
tration of this power that is isolated both from the social body and 
from the judicial power in the strict sense. The emergence of the 
prison marks the institutionalization of the power to punish, or, to be 
more precise: will the power to punish (with the strategic aim adop¬ 
ted in the late eighteenth century, the reduction of popular illegality) 
be better served by concealing itself beneath a general social func¬ 
tion, in the 'punitive city’, or by investing itself in a coercive 
institution, in the enclosed space of the 'reformatory'? 

In any case, it can be said that, in the late eighteenth century, one 
is confronted by three ways of organizing the power to punish. The 
first is the one that was still functioning and which was based on the 
old monarchical law. The other two both refer to a preventive, 
utilitarian, corrective conception of a right to punish that belong:- 
to society as a whole; but they are very different from one another 
at the level of the mechanisms they envisage. Broadly speaking, one 
might say that, in monarchical law, punishment is a ceremonial of 
sovereignty; it uses the ritual marks of the vengeance that it applies 
to the body of the condemned man; and it deploys before the eyes 
of the spectators an effect of terror as intense as it is discontinuous, 
irregular and always above its own laws, the physical presence of the 
sovereign and of his power. The reforming jurists, on the other 
hand, saw punishment as a procedure for requalifying individuals 
as subjects, as juridical subjects; it uses not marks, but signs, coded 
sets of representations, which would be given the most rapid 
circulation and the most general acceptance possible by citizens 


witnessing the scene of punishment. Lastly, in the project for a 
prison institution that was then developing, punishment was seen 
as a technique for the coercion of individuals; it operated methods 
of training the body - not signs - by the traces it leaves, in the form 
of habits, in behaviour; and it presupposed the setting up of a 
specific power for the administration of the penalty. We have, then, 
the sovereign and his force, the social body and the administrative 
apparatus; mark, sign, trace; ceremony, representation, exercise; 
the vanquished enemy, the juridical subject in the process of re- 
qual fication, the individual subjected to immediate coercion; the 
tortured body, the soul with its manipulated representations, the 
body subjected to training. We have here the three series of elements 
that characterize the three mechanisms that face one another in the 
second half of the eighteenth century. They cannot be reduced to 
theories of law (though they overlap with such theories), nor can 
they be identified with apparatuses or institutions (though they are 
based on them), nor can they be derived from moral choices (though 
they find their justification in morality). They are modalities accord¬ 
ing to which the power to punish is exercised: three technologies of 
power. 

The problem, then, is the following: how is it that, in the end, 
it was the third that was adopted? How did the coercive, corporal, 
solitary, secret model of the power to punish replace the representa¬ 
tive, scenic, signifying, public, collective model? Why did the 
physical exercise of punishment (which is not torture) replace, with 
the prison that is its institutional support, the social play of the signs 
of punishment and the prolix festival that circulated them? 












i. Docile bodies 


Lei us lake ihe ideal figure of the soldier as it was still seen in the 
early seventeenth century. To begin with, the soldier was someone 
who could be recognized from afar; he bore certain signs: the natural 
signs of his strength and his courage, the marks, too, of his pride; 
his body was the blazon of his strength and valour; and although it 
is true that he had to learn the profession of arms little by little - 
generally in actual fighting - movements like marching and attitudes 
like the bearing of the head belonged for the most part to a bodily 
rhetoric of honour; ‘The signs for recognizing those most suited to 
this profession arc a lively, alert manner, an erect head, a taut 
stomach, broad shoulders, long arms, strong fingers, a small belly, 
thick thighs, slender legs and dry feet, because a man of such a 
figure could not fail to be agile and strong’; when he becomes a pike- 
bearer, the soldier 'will have to march in step in order to have as 
much grace and gravity as possible, for the pike is an honourable 
weapon, worthy to be borne with gravity and boldness’ (Mont- 
gommery, 6 and 7). By the late eighteenth century, the soldier has 
become something that can be made; out of a formless clay, an inapt 
body, the machine required can be constructed; posture is gradually 
corrected; a calculated constraint runs slowly through each part of 
the body, mastering it, making it pliable, ready at all times, turning 
silently into the automatism of habit; in short, one has ’got rid of 
the peasant’ and given him ‘the air of a soldier’ (ordinance of 10 
March 1764). Recruits become accustomed to ‘holding their heads 
high and erect; to standing upright, without bending the back, to 
sticking out the belly, throwing out the chest and throwing back the 
shoulders; and, to help them acquire the habit, they are given this 
position while standing against a wall in such a way that the heels, 
the thighs, the waist and the shoulders touch it, as also do the backs

of the hands, as one turns the arms outwards, without moving them 
away from the body. . . Likewise, they will be taught never to fix 
their eyes on the ground, but to look straight at those they pass ... 
to remain motionless until the order is given, without moving the 
head, the hands or the feet. .. lastly to march with a bold step, with 
knee and ham taut, on the points of the feet, which should face 
outwards’ (ordinance of 20 March 1764). 

The classical age discovered the body as object and target of 
power. It is easy enough to find signs of the attention then paid to 
the body - to the body that is manipulated, shaped, trained, which 
obeys, responds, becomes skilful and increases its forces. The great 
book of Man-the-Machine was written simultaneously on two 
registers: the anatomico-metaphysical register, of which Descartes 
wrote the first pages and which the physicians and philosophers 
continued, and the tcchnico-political register, which was constituted 
by a whole set of regulations and by empirical and calculated 
methods relating to the army, the school and the hospital, for con¬ 
trolling or correcting the operations of the body. These two regis¬ 
ters arc quite distinct, since it was a question, on the one hand, of 
submission and use and, on the other, of functioning and explana¬ 
tion: there was a useful body and an intelligible body. And yet there 
arc points of overlap from one to the other. La Mcttric’s L'Homme- 
machine is both a materialist reduction of the soul and a general 
theory of dressage , at the centre of which reigns the notion of 
'docility', which joins the analysable body to the manipulate body. 
A body is docile that may be subjected, used, transformed and 
improved. The celebrated automata, on the other hand, were not 
only a way of illustrating an organism, they were also political 
puppets, small-scale models of power: Frederick II, the meticulous 
king of small machines, well-trained regiments and long exercises, 
was obsessed with them. 

What was so new in these projects of docility that interested the 
eighteenth century so much? It was certainly not the first time that 
the body had become the object of such imperious and pressing 
investments; in every society, the body was in the grip of ver\ 
strict powers, which imposed on it constraints, prohibitions or 
obligations. However, there were several new things in these tech¬ 
niques. To begin with, there was the scale of the control: it was a 


Docile bodies 


question not of treating the body, en masse , ‘w holesale’, as if it were 
an indissociable unity, but of working it 'retail', individually; of 
exercising upon it a subtle coercion, of obtaining holds upon it at the 
level of the mechanism itself - movements, gestures, altitudes, 
rapidity: an infinitesimal power over the active body. Then there 
was the object of the control: it was not or was no longer the signify¬ 
ing elements of behaviour or the language of the body, but the 
economy, the efficiency of movements, their internal organization; 
constraint bears upon the forces rather than upon the signs; the only 
truly important ceremony is that of exercise. Lastly, there is the 
modality: it implies an uninterrupted, constant coercion, super¬ 
vising the processes of the activity rather than its result and it is 
exercised according to a codification that partitions as closely as 
possible time, space, movement. These methods, which made 
possible the meticulous control of the operations of the body, 
which assured the constant subjection of its forces and imposed 
upon them a relation of docility-utility, might be called ‘disciplines’. 
Many disciplinary’ methods had long been in existence - in monas¬ 
teries, armies, workshops. But in the course of the seventeenth and 

1 eighteenth centuries the disciplines became general formulas of 
domination. They were different from slavery because they were 
not based on a relation of appropriation of bodies; indeed, the 
elegance of the discipline lay in the fact that it could dispense with 
this costly and violent relation by obtaining effects of utility at least 
as great. They were different, too, from ‘service’, which was a 

( constant, total, massive, non-analytical, unlimited relation of 
domination, established in the form of the individual will of the 

1 master, his ‘caprice’. They were different from vassalage, which was 
j highly coded, but distant relation of submission, which bore less 
on the operations of the body than on the products of labour and 
the ritual marks of allegiance. Again, they were different from 
•sceticism and from ‘disciplines’ of a monastic type, whose function 
was to obtain renunciations rather than increases of utility and 
which, although they involved obedience to others, had as their 
principal aim an increase of the mastery of each individual over his 
own body. The historical moment of the disciplines was the moment 
when an an of the human body was bom, which was directed not 
only at the growth of its skills, nor at the intensification of its 


37 





Discipline 


subjection, but at the formation of a relation that in the mechanism 
itself makes it more obedient as it becomes more useful, and con¬ 
versely. What was then being formed was a policy of coercions 
that act upon the body, a calculated manipulation of its elements, 
its gestures, its behaviour. The human body was entering a machin¬ 
ery of power that explores it, breaks it down and rearranges it. A 
'political anatomy’, which was also a ’mechanics of power’, was 
being born; it defined how one may have a hold over others' bodies, 
not only so that they may do what one wishes, but so that they may 
operate as one wishes, with the techniques, the speed and the effi¬ 
ciency that one determines. Thus discipline produces subjected and 
practised bodies, ’docile’ bodies. Discipline increases the forces of 
the body (in economic terms of utility) and diminishes these same 
forces (in political terms of obedience). In short, it dissociates power 
from the body; on the one hand, it turns it into an ’aptitude’, a 
'capacity', which it seeks to increase; on the other hand, it reverses 
the course of the energy, the power that might result from it, and 
turns it into a relation of strict subjection. If economic exploit¬ 
ation separates the force and the product of labour, let us say 
that disciplinary coercion establishes in the body the con¬ 
stricting link between an increased aptitude and an increased 
domination. 

The ‘invention’ of this new political anatomy must not be seen 
as a sudden discovery. It is rather a multiplicity of often minor 
processes, of different origin and scattered location, which overlap, 
repeat, or imitate one another, support one another, distinguish 
themselves from one another according to their domain of applica¬ 
tion, converge and gradually produce the blueprint of a general 
method. They were at work in secondary education at a very early 
date, later in primary schools; they slowly invested the space of the 
hospital; and, in a few decades, they restructured the military 
organization. They sometimes circulated very rapidly from one 
point to another (between the army and the technical schools or 
secondary schools), sometimes slowly and discreetly (the insidious 
militarization of the large workshops). On almost every occasion, 
they were adopted in response to particular needs: an industrial 
innovation, a renewed outbreak of certain epidemic diseases, the 
invention of the rifle or the victories of Prussia. This did not prevent 


Docile bodies 


them being totally inscribed in general and essential transforma¬ 
tions, which we must now try to delineate. 

There can be no question here of writing the history of the 
different disciplinary institutions, with all their individual differ¬ 
ences. I simply intend to map on a series of examples some of the 
essential techniques that most easily spread from one to another. 
These were always meticulous, often minute, techniques, but they 
had their importance: because they defined a certain mode of 
detailed political investment of the body, a 'new micro-physics’ of 
power; and because, since the seventeenth century, they had con¬ 
stantly reached out to ever broader domains, as if they tended to 
cover the entire social body. Small acts of cunning endowed with a 
great power of diffusion, subtle arrangements, apparently innocent, 
but profoundly suspicious, mechanisms that obeyed economies too 
shameful to be acknowledged, or pursued petty forms of coercion - 
it was nevertheless they that brought about the mutation of the 
punitive system, at the threshold of the contemporary period. De¬ 
scribing them will require great attention to detail: beneath every set 
of figures, we must seek not a meaning, but a precaution; we must 
situate them not only in the inextricability of a functioning, but in 
the coherence of a tactic. They are the acts of cunning, not so much 
of the greater reason that works even in its sleep and gives meaning 
to the insignificant, as of the attentive ‘malevolence’ that turns 
everything to account. Discipline is a political anatomy of detail. 

Before we lose patience we would do well to recall the words of 
Marshal de Saxe: ‘Although those who concern themselves with 
details are regarded as folk of limited intelligence, it seems to me 
that this part is essential, because it is the foundation, and it is 
impossible to erect any building or establish any method without 
understanding its principles. It is not enough to have a liking for 
architecture. One must also know stone-cutting’ (Saxe, 5). There is 
.1 whole history to be written about such 'stone-cutting' - a history 
of the utilitarian rationalization of detail in moral accountability and 
political control. The classical age did not initiate it; rather it 
accelerated it, changed its scale, gave it precise instruments, and 
perhaps found some echoes for it in the calculation of the infinitely 
small or in the description of the most detailed characteristics of 
natural beings. In any case, ‘detail’ had long been a category of 

1 39 



Discipline 


Docile bodies 


theology and asceticism: every detail is important since, in the sight 
of God, no immensity is greater than a detail, nor is anything so 
small that it was not willed by one of his individual wishes. In this 
great tradition of the eminence of detail, all the minutiae of Chris¬ 
tian education, of scholastic or military pedagogy, all forms of 
‘training’ found their place easily enough. For the disciplined man, 
as for the true believer, no detail is unimportant, but not so much 
for the meaning that it conceals within it as for the hold it provides 
for the power that wishes to seize it. Characteristic is the great hymn 
to the ‘little things’ and to their eternal importance, sung by Jean- 
Baptiste de La Salle, in his Traiti sur Us obligations des freres tUs 
lie ales chritiennes . The mystique of the everyday is joined here with 
the discipline of the minute. 'How dangerous it is to neglect little 
things. It is a very consoling reflection for a soul like mine, little 
disposed to great actions, to think that fidelity to little things may, 
by an imperceptible progress, raise us to the most eminent sanctity: 
because little things lead to greater ... Little things; it will be said, 
alas, my God, what can we do that is great for you, weak and mortal 
creatures that we are. Little things; if great things presented them¬ 
selves would we perform them? Would we not think them beyond 
our strength? Little things; and if God accepts them and wishes to 
receive them as great things? Little things; has one ever felt this? 
Docs one judge according to experience? Little things; one is cer¬ 
tainly guilty, therefore, if seeing them as such, one refuses them? 
Little things; yet it is they that in the end have made great saints! 
Yes, little things; but great motives, great feelings, great fervour, 
great ardour, and consequently great merits, great treasures, great 
rewards’ (La Salle, Traiti ..., 238-9). The meticulousness of 
the regulations, the fussiness of the inspections, the supervision of 
the smallest fragment of life and of the body will soon provide, in the 
context of the school, the barracks, the hospital or the workshop, 
a laicized content, an economic or technical rationality for this 
mystical calculus of the infinitesimal and the infinite. And a History 
of Detail in the eighteenth century, presided over by Jean-Baptistc 
dc La Salle, touching on Leibniz and Buffon, via Frederick II, 
covering pedagogy, medicine, military tactics and economics, 
should bring us, at the end of the century, to the man who dreamt 
of being another Newton, not the Newton of the immensities of 


the heavens and the planetary masses, but a Newton of ‘small 
bodies’, small movements, small actions; to the man who replied 
to Monge’s remark, 'there was only one world to discover’: 'What 
do I hear? But the world of details, who has never dreamt of that 
other world, what of that world? I have believed in it ever since I 
was fifteen. I was concerned with it then, and this memory lives 
within me, as an obsession never to be abandoned. . . That other 
world is the most important of all that I flatter myself I have dis¬ 
covered: when I think of it, my heart aches’ (these words are 
attributed to Bonaparte in the Introduction to Saint-Hilaire’s 
Notions synthitiques et historiques de philosophic naturelle). Napoleon 
did net discover this world; but we know that he set out to organize 
it; and he wished to arrange around him a mechanism of power that 
would enable him to see the smallest event that occurred in the state 
he governed; he intended, by means of the rigorous discipline that he 
imposed, 'to embrace the whole of this vast machine without the 
slightest detail escaping his attention' (Treilhard, 14). 

A meticulous observation of detail, and at the same time a 
political awareness of these small things, for the control and use of 
men, emerge through the classical age bearing with them a whole 
vet of techniques, a whole corpus of methods and knowledge, 
>tions, plans and data. And from such trifles, no doubt, the 
of modem humanism was born. 1 


The art of distributions 

In the first instance, discipline proceeds from the distribution of in- 
ividuals in space. To achieve this end, it employs several techniques. 

t. Discipline sometimes requires enclosure , the specification of a 
place heterogeneous to all others and closed in upon itself. It is the 
itccted place of disciplinary monotony. There was the great 
;ment' of vagabonds and paupers; there were other more 
hscreet, but insidious and effective ones. There were the colleges, 
secondary schools: the monastic model was gradually imposed; 
ling appeared as the most perfect, if not the most frequent, 
tional regime; it became obligatory at Louis-le-Grand when, 
fier the departure of the Jesuits, it w-as turned into a model school 
f. Aries, 308-13 and Snyders, 33-4')- There were the military 









Discipline 


barracks: the army, that vagabond mass, has to be held in place; 
looting and violence must be prevented; the fears of local inhabi¬ 
tants, who do not care for troops passing through their towns, 
must be calmed; conflicts with the civil authorities must be avoided; 
desertion must be stopped, expenditure controlled. The ordinance 
of 1719 envisaged the construction of several hundred barracks, 
on the model of those already set up in the south of the country; 
there would be strict confinements: ‘The whole will be enclosed by 
an outer wall ten feet high, which will surround the said houses, at 
a distance of thirty feet from all the sides'; this will have the effect 
of maintaining the troops in ‘order and discipline, so that an officer 
will be in a position to answer for them' ( L'Ordonnanct militaire , 
IXL, 25 September 1719). In 174S* there were barracks in about 
320 towns; and it was estimated that the total capacity of the bar¬ 
racks in 1775 was approximately 200,000 men (Daisy, 201-9; an 
anonymous memoir of 1775, in Depdt de la guerre, 3689, f. 156; 
Navercau, 132-5). Side by side with the spread of workshops, there 
also developed great manufacturing spaces, both homogeneous and 
well defined: first, the combined manufactories, then, in the second 
half of the eighteenth century, the works or factories proper (the 
Chaussadc ironworks occupied almost the whole of the Medinc 
peninsula, between Niivre and Loire; in order to set up the Indret 
factory in 1777, Wilkinson, by means of embankments and dikes, 
constructed an island on the Loire; Toufait built Le Creusot in the 
valley of the Charbonniirc, which he transformed, and he had 
workers' accommodation built in the factory itself); it was a change 
of scale, but it was also a new type of control. The factory was 
explicitly compared with the monastery, the fortress, a walled town; 
the guardian 'will open the gates only on the return of the workers, 
and after the bell that announces the resumption of work has been 
rung'; a quarter of an hour later no one will be admitted; at the end 
of the day, the workshops’ heads will hand back the keys to the Swiss 
guard of the factory, who will then open the gates (Amboisc, t 
12,1301). The aim is to derive the maximum advantages and to 
neutralize the inconveniences (thefts, interruptions of work, dis¬ 
turbances and ’cabals'), as the forces of production become more 
concentrated; to protect materials and tools and to master the labour 
force: ‘The order and inspection that must be maintained require 


Docile bodies 


that all workers be assembled under ihe same roof, so that the part¬ 
ner who is entrusted with the management of the manufactory may 
prevent and remedy abuses that may arise among the workers and 
arrest their progress at the outset' (Dauphin, 199). 

2. But the principle of ‘enclosure' is neither constant, nor indis¬ 
pensable, nor sufficient in disciplinary machinery. This machinery 
works space in a much more flexible and derailed way. It does this 
first of all on the principle of elementary location or partitioning. 
Each individual has his own place; and each place its individual. 
Avoid distributions in groups; break up collective dispositions; 
analyse confused, massive or transient pluralities. Disciplinary space 
tends to be divided into as many sections as there are bodies or 
elements to be distributed. One must eliminate the effects of impre¬ 
cise distributions, the uncontrolled disappearance of individuals, 
their diffuse circulation, their unusable and dangerous coagulation; 
it was a tactic of anti-desertion, anti-vagabondage, anti-concentra¬ 
tion. Its aim was to establish presences and absences, to know where 
jnd how to locate individuals, to set up useful communications, to 
interrupt others, to be able at cadi moment to supervise the conduct 
of each individual, to assess it, to judge it, to calculate its qualities 
nr merits. It was a procedure, therefore, aimed at knowing, master¬ 
ing ard using. Discipline organizes an analytical space. 

I re, too, it encountered an old architectural and religious 
le monastic cell. Even if the compartments it assigns 
ircly ideal, the disriplinary space is always, basically, 
litude was necessary to both body and soul, according to 
ceticism: they must, at certain moments at least, confront 
and perhaps the seventy of God alone. 'Sleep is the 
eath, the dormitory is the image of the sepulchre ... 
he dormitories are shared, the beds are nevertheless 
1 such a way and closed so exactly by means of curtains 
Is may rise and retire without being seen’ (Reglementpour 
vti des files du Bon Pasteur , in Delamare, 507). But this 
■y crude form. 

ule of functional sites would gradually, in the disciplinary 
, code a space that architecture generally left at the dis- 
rveral different uses. Particular places were defined to 
not only to the need to supervise, to break dangerous 





Discipline 


communications, but also to create a useful space. The process 
appeared clearly in the hospitals, especially in the military and naval 
hospitals. In France, it seems that Rochefort served both as experi¬ 
ment and model. A port, and a military port is - with its circulation 
of goods, men signed up willingly or by force, sailors embarking 
and disembarking, diseases and epidemics - a place of desertion, 
smuggling, contagion: it is a crossroads for dangerous mixtures, a 
meeting-place for forbidden circulations. The naval hospital must 
therefore treat, but in order to do this it must be a filter, a mechanism 
that pins down and partitions; it must provide a hold over this whole 
mobile, swarming mass, by dissipating the confusion of illegality 
and evil. The medical supervision of diseases and contagions 
inseparable from a whole series of other controls: the military control 
over deserters, fiscal control over commodities, administrative con 
trol over remedies, rations, disappearances, cures, deaths, Simula 
tions. Hence the need to distribute and partition off space in 
rigorous manner. The first steps taken at Rochefort concerned 
things rather than men, precious commodities, rather than patients 
The arrangements of fiscal and economic supervision preceded the 
techniques of medical observation: placing of medicines under lock 
and key, recording their use; a little later, a system was worked out 
to verify the real number of patients, their identity, the units to 
which they belonged; then one began to regulate their comings and 
goings; they were forced to remain in their wards; to each bed wj* 
attached the name of its occupant; each individual treated w.n 
entered in a register that the doctor had to consult during the visit, 
later came the isolation of contagious patients and separate bed*. 
Gradually, an administrative and political space was articulated upon 
a therapeutic space; it tended to individualize bodies, disease*, 
symptoms, lives and deaths; it constituted a real table of juxtaposed 
and carefully distinct singularities. Out of discipline, a medically 
useful space was born. 

In the factories that appeared at the end of the eighteenth centur\ 
the principle of individualizing partitioning became more com 
cated. It was a question of distributing individuals in a space 
which one might isolate them and map them; but also of articulati 
this distribution on a production machinery that had its own 
quirements. The distribution of bodies, the spatial arrangement * I 


Docile bodies 



production machinery and the different forms of activity in the 
distribution of 'posts’ had to be linked together. The Oberkampf 
manufactory at Jouy obeyed this principle. It was made up of a 
scries of workshops specified according to each broad type of opera¬ 
tion: for the printers, the handlers, the colourists, the women who 
touched up the design, the engravers, the dyers. The largest of the 
buildings, built in i79», by Toussaint Barre, was no metres long 
and had three storeys. The ground floor was devoted mainly to 
block printing; it contained 132 tables arranged in two rows, the 
length of the workshop, which had eighty-eight windows; each 
printer worked at a table with his ‘puller’, who prepared and spread 
the colours. There were 264 persons in all. At the end of each table 
was a sort of rack on which the material that had just been printed 
left to dry (Saint-Maur). By walking up and down the central 
-isle of the workshop, it was possible to carry out a supervision that 
v*as both general and individual: to observe the worker’s presence 
and application, and the quality of his work; to compare workers 
th one another, to classify them according to skill and speed; 
follow the successive stages of the production process. All these 
izations formed a permanent grid: confusion was eliminated 1 : 
t is to say, production was divided up and the labour process 
articulated, on the one hand, according to its stages or element- 
operations, and, on the other hand, according to the individuals, 
particular bodies, that carried it out: each variable of this force - 
h, promptness, skill, constancy - would be observed, and 
ore characterized, assessed, computed and related to the 
ividual who was its particular agent. Thus, spread out in a per- 
ly legible way over the whole series of individual bodies, the 
k force may be analysed in individual units. At the emergence 
large-scale industry, one finds, beneath the division of the pro¬ 
ion process, the individualizing fragmentation of labour power; 
distributions of the disciplinary space often assured both. 

4 In discipline, the elements are interchangeable, since each is 
ned by the place it occupies in a series, and by the gap that 
tes it from the others. The unit is, therefore, neither the 
lory (unit of domination), nor the place (unit of residence), but 
rank: the place one occupies in a classification, the point at which 
and a column intersect, the interval in a series of intervals that 


MS 







Discipline 


nun may traverse one after the other. Discipline is an art of rank, 

. technique for the transformation of arrangements. It individualizes 
bodies by a location that docs not give them a fixed position, but 
distributes them and circulates them in a network of relations. 

l ake the example of the ‘class’. In the Jesuit colleges, one still 
found an organization that was at once binary and unified; the 
classes, which might comprise up to two or three hundred pupils, 
were subdivided into groups of ten; each of these groups, with its 
‘dccurion’, was placed in a camp, Roman or Carthaginian; each 
•decury* had its counterpart in the opposing camp. The general 
form was that of war and rivalry; work, apprenticeship and classifi¬ 
cation were carried out in the form of the joust, through the con¬ 
frontation of two armies; the contribution of each pupil was in¬ 
scribed in this general duel; it contributed to the victory- or the 
defeat of a whole camp; and the pupils were assigned a place that 
corresponded to the function of each individual and to his value as 
a combatant in the unitary group of his ‘decury’ (Rochcmonteix, 

5iff). It should be observed moreover that this Roman comedy 
made it possible to link, 10 die binary exercises of rivalry, a spatial 
disposition inspired by the legion, with rank, hierarchy, pyramidal . 
supervision. One should not forget that, generally speaking, the 
Roman model, at the Enlightenment, played a dual role: in it' 
republican aspect, it was the very embodiment of liberty; in it- 
military aspect, it was the ideal schema of discipline. The Rome ot 
the eighteenth century and of the Revolution was the Rome of the I 
Senate, but it was also that of the legion; it was the Rome of the 
Forum, but it was also that of the camps. Up to the empire, the I 
Roman reference transmitted, somewhat ambiguously, the juridical 
ideal of citizenship and the technique of disciplinary methods. In I 
any case, the strictly disciplinary element in the ancient fable used by I 
the Jesuit colleges came to dominate the element of joust and m< • I 
warfare. Gradually - but especially after 1762 - the educational! 
space unfolds; the class becomes homogeneous, it is no longer made I 
up of individual elements arranged side by side under the master’*! 
eye. In the eighteenth century, ‘rank’ begins to define the great form! 
of distribution of individuals in the educational order: rows or ranks! 
of pupils in the class, corridors, courtyards; rank attributed to ea« '•! 
pupil at the end of each task and each examination; the rank #1 

146

obtains from week to week, month to month, year to year; an 
alignment of age groups, one after another; a succession of subjects 
taught and questions treated, according to an order of increasing 
difficulty. And, in this ensemble of compulsory alignments, each 
pupil, according to his age, his performance, his behaviour, occupies 
sometimes one rank, sometimes another; he moves constantly over 
a series of compartments - some of these are ‘ideal’ compartments, 
marking a hierarchy of knowledge or ability, others express the 
distribution of values or merits in material terms in the space of the 
college or classroom. It is a perpetual movement in which individuals 
replace one another in a space marked off by aligned intervals. 

The organization of a serial space was one of the great technical 
mutations of elementary education. It made it possible to supersede 

I itional system (a pupil working for a few minutes with the 
while the rest of the heterogeneous group remained idle and 
Jed). By assigning individual places it made possible the 
tion of each individual and the simultaneous work of all. It 
rd a new economy of the time of apprenticeship. It made the 
>nal space funciion like a learning machine, but also as a 
: for supervising, hierarchizing, rewarding. Jean-Baptistc de 
! dreamt of a classroom in which the spatial distribution 
rovide a whole series of distinctions at once: according to 
ils’ progress, worth, character, application, cleanliness and 
fortune. Thus, the classroom would form a single great 
ith many different entries, under the scrupulously ‘classi- 
eye of the master: 'In every class there will be places 
for all the pupils of all the lessons, so that all those attending 
: lesson will always occupy the same place. Pupils attending 
est lessons will be placed in the benches closest to the wall, 

I by the others according to the order of the lessons moving 
the middle of the classroom. . . Each of the pupils will 
place assigned to him and none of them will leave it or 
it except on the order or with the consent of the school 
r.’ Tilings must be so arranged that ‘those whose parents 
jetful and verminous must be separated from those who are 
ind clean; that an unruly and frivolous pupil should be 
etween two who are well behaved and serious, a libertine 
one or between two pious pupils’.* 


I )Ucipline 


Docile bodies 


In organizing ‘cells', 'places' and ‘ranks', the disciplines create 
complex spaces that are at once architectural, functional and hier- 
im liic.il. It is spaces that provide fixed positions and permit circula¬ 
tion; they carve out individual segments and establish operational 
link*; they mark places and indicate values; they guarantee the 
obedience of individuals, but also a better economy of time and 
gesture. They are mixed spaces: real because they govern the dis¬ 
position of buildings, rooms, furniture, but also ideal, because they 
ur projected over this arrangement of characterizations, assessments, 
hierarchies. The first of the great operations of discipline is, there¬ 
fore, the constitution of 'tableaux vivants", which transform the 
confused, useless or dangerous multitudes into ordered multiplici¬ 
ties. The drawing up of'tables' was one of the great problems of the 
scientific, political and economic technology of the eighteenth 
century: how one was to arrange botanical and zoological gardens, 
and construct at the same time rational classifications of living beings; 
how one was to observe, supervise, regularize the circulation of 
commodities and money and thus build up an economic table that 
might serve as the principle of the increase of wealth; how one was 
to inspect men, observe their presence and absence and constitute 
a general and permanent register of the armed forces; how one was 
to distribute patients, separate them from one another, divide up 
the hospital space and make a systematic classification of diseases: 
these were all twin operations in which the two elements - distribu¬ 
tion and analysis, supervision and intelligibility - are inextricably 
bound up. In the eighteenth century, the table was both a technique 
of power and a procedure of knowledge. It was a question of 
organizing the multiple, of providing oneself with an instrument to 
cover it and to master it; it was a question of imposing upon it an 
‘order’. Like the army general of whom Guibert spoke, the natural¬ 
ist, the physician, the economist was 'blinded by the immensity, 
dazed by the multitude... the innumerable combinations that result 
from the multiplicity of objects, so many concerns together form a 
burden above his strength. In perfecting itself, in approaching true 
principles, the science of modern warfare might become simpler and 
less difficult’; armies 'with simple, similar tactics, capable of being 
adapted to every movement... would be easier to move and lead’ 
(Guibert, xxxvi). Tactics, the spatial ordering of men; taxonomy. 


the disciplinary space of natural beings; the economic table, the 
regulated movement of wealth. 

But the table does not have the same function in these different 
registers. In the order of the economy, it makes possible the 
measurement of quantities and the analysis of movements. In the 
form of taxonomy, it has the function of characterizing (and con¬ 
sequently reducing individual singularities) and constituting classes 
(and therefore of excluding considerations of number). But in the 
form of the disciplinary- distribution, on the other hand, the table 
has the function of treating multiplicity itself, distributing it and 
deriving from it as many effects as possible. Whereas natural 
taxonomy is situated on the axis that links character and category, 
disciplinary tactics is situated on the axis that links the singular and 
the multiple. It allows both the characterization of the individual 
as individual and the ordering of a given multiplicity. It is the first 
condition for the control and use of an ensemble of distinct elements: 
the base for a micro-physics of what might be called a 'cellular' 
power. 

The control of activity 

i. The time-table is an old inheritance. The strict model was no 
doubt suggested by the monastic communities. It soon spread. Its 
three great methods - establish rhythms, impose particular occupa¬ 
tions, regulate the cycles of repetition - were soon to be found in 
schools, workshops and hospitals. The new disciplines had no diffi¬ 
culty in taking up their place in the old forms; the schools and poor- 
houses extended the life and the regularity of the monastic com¬ 
munities to which they were often attached. The rigours of the 
industrial period long retained a religious air; in the seventeenth 
century, the regulations of die great manufactories laid down the 
exercises that would divide up the working day: ‘On arrival in the 
morning, before beginning their work, all persons shall wash their 
hands, offer up their work to God and make the sign of the cross' 

(Saint-Maur, article i); but even in the nineteenth century, when the 
rural populations were needed in industry, they were sometimes 
lormed into 'congregations’, in an attempt to inure them to work 
in the workshops; the framework of the ‘factory-monastery’ was 




Discipline 


imposed upon the workers. In the Protestant armies of Maurice of 
Orange and Gustavus Adolphus, military discipline was achieved 
through a rhythmics of time punctuated by pious exercises; army 
life, Boussanelle was later to say, should have some of the 'perfec¬ 
tions of the cloister itself’ (Boussanelle, 2; on the religious character 
of discipline in the Swedish army, cf. The Swedish Discipline , 
London, 1632). For centuries, the religious orders had been masters 
of discipline: they were the specialists of time, the great technicians 
of rhythm and regular activities. But the disciplines altered these 
methods of temporal regulation from which they derived. They 
altered them first by refining them. One began to count in quarter 
hours, in minutes, in seconds. This happened in the army, of course: 
Guibert systematically implemented the chronomctric measurement 
of shooting that had been suggested earlier by Vauban. In the ele¬ 
mentary schools, the division of time became increasingly minute; 
activities were governed in detail by orders that had to be obeyed 
immediately: 'At the last stroke of the hour, a pupil will ring the 
bell, and at the first sound of the bell all the pupils will kneel, with 
their arms crossed and their eyes lowered. When the prayer has been 
said, the teachei will strike the signal once to indicate that the pupils 
should get up, a second time as a sign that they should salute Christ, 
and a third that they should sit down’ (La Salle, Conduite ..., 27-8). 
In the early nineteenth century, the following time-table was sug¬ 
gested for the Ecoles muiuelles , or 'mutual improvement schools': 
8.45 entrance of the monitor, 8.52 the monitor's summons, 8.56 
entrance of the children and prayer, 9.00 the children go to their 
benches, 9.04 first slate, 9.08 end of dictation, 9.12 second slate, etc. 
(Tronchot, 221). The gradual extension of the wage-earning class 
brought with it a more detailed partitioning of time: 'If workers 
arrive later than a quarter of an hour after the ringing of the bell...’ 
(Amboise, article 2); ‘if any one of the companions is asked for 
during work and loses more than five minutes ...’, 'anyone who is 
not at his work at the correct time ...’ (Oppenheim, article 7-8). 
But an attempt is also made to assure the quality of the time used: 
constant supervision, the pressure of supervisors, the elimination of 
anything that might disturb or distract; it is a question of constitut¬ 
ing a totally useful time: ‘It is expressly forbidden during work to 
amuse one’s companions by gestures or in any other way, to play 


150 


Docile bodies 


at any game whatsoever, to eat, to sleep, to tell stories and comedies' 
(Oppenheim, article 16); and even during the meal-break, ‘there will 
be no telling of stories, adventures or other such talk that distracts 
the workers from their work’; 'it is expressly forbidden for any 
worker, under any pretext, to bring wine into the manufactory and 
to drink in the workshops' {Amboise, article 4). Time measured and 
paid must also be a time without impurities or defects; a time of 
good quality, throughout which the body is constantly applied to 
its exercise. Precision and application are, with regularity, the funda¬ 
mental virtues of disciplinary time. But this is not the newest thing 
about it. Other methods are more characteristic of the disciplines. 

2. The temporal elaboration of the act. There arc, for example, two 
ways of controlling marching troops. In the early seventeenth 
century, we have: 'Accustomed soldiers marching in file or in 
battalion to march to the rhythm of the drum. And to do this, one 
must begin with the right foot so that the whole troop raises the 
same foot at the same time’ (Montgommery, 86 ). In the mid- 
cightccnth century, there are four sorts of steps: 'The length of the 
the short step will be a foot, that of the ordinary step, the double 
step and the marching step will be two feet, the whole measured from 
one heel to the next; as for the duration, that of the small step and 
the ordinary step will last one second, during which two double 
steps would be performed; the duration of the marching step will be 
4 little longer than one second. The oblique step will take one 

F second; it will be at most eighteen inches from one heel to the next. 

... The ordinary step will be executed forwards, holding the head 
up high and the body erect, holding oneself in balance successively 
on a single leg, and bringing the other forwards, the ham taut, the 
point of the foot a little turned outwards and low, so that one may 
without affectation brush the ground on which one must walk and 
place one's foot, in such a way that each part may come to rest there 
hi the same time without striking the ground’ (‘Ordonnance du i cr 
janvier 1766, pour regler 1 'cxcrcisc dc I’infanterie’). Between these 
two instructions, a new set of restraints had been brought into play, 
another degree of precision in the breakdown of gestures and move¬ 
ments, another way of adjusting the body to temporal imperatives. 

What the ordinance of 1766 defines is not a time-table - the 
general framework for an activity; it is rather a collective and 



Discipline 


obligatory rhythm, imposed from the outside; it is a 'programme'; 
it assures the elaboration of the act itself; it controls its development 
and its stages from the inside. We have passed from a form of 
injunction that measured or punctuated gestures to a web that con¬ 
strains them or sustains them throughout their entire succession. A 
sort of anatomo-chronological schema of behaviour is defined. The 
act is broken down into its elements; the position of the body, limbs, 
articulations is defined; to each movement are assigned a direction, 
an aptitude, a duration; their order of succession is prescribed. Time 
penetrates the body and with it all the meticulous controls of power. 

3. Hence the correlation of the body and the gesture. Disciplinary 
control does not consist simply in teaching or imposing a series of 
particular gestures; it imposes the best relation between a gesture 
and the overall position of the body, which is its condition of effi¬ 
ciency and speed. In the correct use of the body, which makes 
possible a correct use of time, nothing must remain idle or useless: 
everything must be called upon to form the support of the act 
required. A well-disciplined body forms the operational context of 
the slightest gesture. Good handwriting, for example, presupposes 

a gymnastics - a whole routine whose rigorous code invests the body I 
in its entirety, from the points of the feet to the tip of the index 
finger. The pupils must always 'hold their bodies erect, somewhat 
turned and free on the left side, slightly inclined, so that, with the 
elbow placed on the table, the chin can be rested upon the hand, 
unless this were to interfere with the view; the left leg must be some 
what more forward under the table than the right. A distance of two 
fingers must be left between the body and the table; for not only 
does one write with more alertness, but nothing is more harmful 
to the health than to acquire the habit of pressing one’s stomach 
against the table; the part of the left arm from the elbow to the hand 
must be placed on the table. The right arm must be at a distance 
from the body of about three fingers and be about five fingers from 
the table, on which it must rest lightly. The teacher will place tli<* 
pupils in the posture that they should maintain when writing, and 
will correct it either by sign or otherwise, when they change thi» I 
position’ (La Salle, Conduite ..., 63-4). A disciplined body is thr I 
prerequisite of an efficient gesture. 

4. The body-object articulation. Discipline defines each of thr I 


«S* 


Docile bodies 


relations that the body must have w’ith the object that it manipulates. 
Between them, it outlines a meticulous meshing. ‘Bring the weapon 
forward. In three stages. Raise the rifle with the right hand, bringing 
it close to the body so as to hold it perpendicular with the right 
knee, the end of the barrel at eye level, grasping it by striking it with 
the right hand, the arm held close to the body at waist height. At the 
second stage, bring the rifle in front of ypu with the left hand, the 
barrel in the middle between the two eyes, vertical, the right hand 
grasping it at the small of the butt, the arm outstretched, the trigger- 
guard resting on the first finger, the left hand at the height of the 
notch, the thumb lying along the barrel against the moulding. At 
the third stage, let go of the rifle with the left hand, which falls along 
the thigh, raising the rifle with the right hand, the lock outwards 
and opposite the chest, the right arm half flexed, the elbow close to 
the body, the thumb lying against the lock, resting against the first 
screw, the hammer resting on the first finger, the barrel perpendicu¬ 
lar’ ('Ordonnance du t er janvier 17 66 ..., litre XI, article 2’). This 
is an example of what might be called the instrumental coding of the 
body. It consists of a breakdown of the total gesture into two parallel 
series: that of the parts of the body to be used (right hand, left hand, 
different fingers of the hand, knee, eye, elbow, etc.) and that of the 
parts of the object manipulated (barrel, notch, hammer, screw, etc.); 
then the two sets of parts are correlated together according to a 
number of simple gestures (rest, bend); lastly, it fixes the canonical 
succession in which each of these correlations occupies a particular 
place. This obligatory syntax is what the military theoreticians of 
the eighteenth century called 'manoeuvre'. The traditional recipe 
gives place to explicit and obligatory prescriptions. Over the whole 
•urface of contact between the body and the object it handles, power 
is introduced, fastening them to one another. It constitutes a body- 
weapon, body-tool, body-machine complex. One is as far as possible 
from those forms of subjection that demanded of the body only 
signs or products, forms of expression or the result of labour. 
The regulation imposed by pow-er is at the same time the law of 
construction of the operation. Thus disciplinary power appears to 
have the function not so much of deduction as of synthesis, not so 
much of exploitation of the product as of coercive link with the 
apparatus of production.

5. Exhaustive use. The principle that underlay the time-table in 
its traditional form was essentially negative; it was the principle of 
non-idleness: it was forbidden to waste time, which was counted by 
God and paid for by men; the time-table was to eliminate the danger 
of wasting it - a moral offence and economic dishonesty. Discipline, 
on the other hand, arranges a positive economy; it poses the prin¬ 
ciple of a theoretically ever-growing use of time: exhaustion rather 
than use; it is a question of extracting, from time, ever more available 
moments and, from each moment, ever more useful forces. This 
means that one must seek to intensify the use of the slightest 
moment, as if time, in its very fragmentation, were inexhaustible or 
as if, at least by an ever more detailed internal arrangement, one 
could tend towards an ideal point at which one maintained maximum 
speed and maximum efficiency. It was precisely this that was imple¬ 
mented in the celebrated regulations of the Prussian infantry that 
the whole of Europe imitated after the victories of Frederick II: 4 the 
more time is broken down, the more its subdivisions multiply, 
the better one disarticulates it by deploying its internal elements 
under a gaze that supervises them, the more one can accelerate an 
operation, or at least regulate it according to an optimum speed; 
hence this regulation of the time of an action that was so important 
in the army and which was to be so throughout the entire technology 
of human activity: the Prussian regulations of 1743 laid down six 
stages to bring the weapon to one’s foot, four to extend it, thirteen 
to raise it to the shoulder, etc. By other means, the ’mutual improve¬ 
ment school’ was also arranged as a machine to intensify the use of 
time; its organization made it possible to obviate the linear, succes 
sive character of the master’s teaching: it regulated the counterpoint 
of operations performed, at the same moment, by different groups 
of pupils under the direction of monitors and assistants, so that each 
passing moment was filled with many different, but ordered activi¬ 
ties; and, on the other hand, the rhythm imposed by signals, whistles, 
orders imposed on everyone temporal norms that were intended both 
to accelerate the process of learning and to teach speed as a virtue;' 
‘the sole aim of these commands ... is to accustom the children to 
executing well and quickly the same operations, to diminish as far ai 
possible by speed the loss of time caused by moving from one opera¬ 
tion to another’ (Bernard).

Docile bodies 


Through this technique of subjection a new' object was being 
formed; slowly, it superseded the mechanical body — the body com¬ 
posed of solids and assigned movements, the image of which had 
for so long haunted those who dreamt of disciplinary perfection. 
This new object is the natural body, the bearer of forces and the seat 
of duration; it is die body susceptible to specified operations, which 
have their order, their stages, their internal conditions, their con¬ 
stituent elements. In becoming the target for new mechanisms 
of power, the body is offered up to new forms of knowledge. It is 
the body of exercise, rather than of speculative physics; a body 
manipulated by authority, rather than imbued with animal spirits; 
4 body of useful training and not of rational mechanics, but one in 
which, by virtue of that very fact, a number of natural requirements 
•nd functional constraints are beginning to emerge. This is the body 
that Guibert discovered in his critique of excessively artificial move¬ 
ments. In the exercise that is imposed upon it and which it resists, 
the body brings out its essential correlations and spontaneously 
rejects the incompatible: ’On entering most of our training schools, 
.me sees all those unfortunate soldiers in constricting and forced 
attitudes, one secs all their muscles contracted, the circulation of their 
blood interrupted. . . If we studied the intention of nature and the 
construction of the human body, we would find the position and 
the bearing that nature clearly prescribes for the soldier. The head 
must be erect, standing out from the shoulders, sitting perpendicu¬ 
larly between them. It must be turned neither to left nor to right, 
because, in view of the correspondence between the vertebrae of the 

I and the shoulder-blade to which they are attached, none of them 
move in a circular manner without slightly bringing with it 
1 the same side that it moves one of the shoulders and because, 
K>dy no longer being placed squarely, the soldier can no longer 
straight in front of him or serve as a point of alignment. . . 
f the hip-bone, which the ordinance indicates as the point 
lit which the butt end should rest, is not situated the same in all 
, the rifle must be placed more to the right for some, and more 
< left for others. For the same reason of inequality of structure, 
rigger-guard is more or less pressed against the body, depending 
/hether the outer pans of a man’s shoulder is more or less 
y’ (Guiben, 21-2).

Discipline 

We have seen how the procedures of disciplinary distribution had 
their place among the contemporary techniques of classification and 
tabulation; but also how they introduced into them the specific 
problem of individuals and multiplicity. Similarly, the disciplinary 
controls of activity belonged to a whole series of researches, theor¬ 
etical or practical, into the natural machinery of bodies; but they 
began to discover in them specific processes; behaviour and its 
organized requirements gradually replaced the simple physics of 
movement. The body, required to be docile in its minutest opera¬ 
tions, opposes and shows the conditions of functioning proper to an 
organism. Disciplinary power has as its correlative an individuality 
that is not only analytical and ‘cellular', but also natural and 
‘organic’. 


The organiiation of geneses 

In 1667, the edict that set up the manufactory of the Gobelins 
envisaged the organization of a school. Sixty scholarship children 
were to be chosen by the superintendent of royal buildings, entrus¬ 
ted for a time to a master whose task it would be to provide them 
with 'upbringing and instruction’, then apprenticed to the various 
master tapestry makers of the manufactory (who by virtue of this 
fact received compensation deducted from the pupils’ scholarships); 
after six years’ apprenticeship, four years of service and a qualifying 
examination, they w-cre given the right to ‘set up and run a shop’ 
in any town of the kingdom. We find here the characteristics of 
guild apprenticeship: the relation of dependence on the master that 
is both individual and total; the statutory duration of the training, 
which is concluded by a qualifying examination, but which is not 
broken down according to a precise programme; an overall exchange 
between the master who must give his knowledge and the appren 
tice who must offer his services, his assistance and often some pay¬ 
ment. The form of domestic service is mixed with a transference of 
knowledge. 8 In 1737, an edict organized a school of drawing for 
the apprentices of the Gobelins; it was not intended to replace the 
training given by the master workers, but to complement it. It 
involved a quite different arrangement of time. Two hours a day, 
except on Sundays and feast days, the pupils met in the school. A 


Docile bodies 


roll-call was taken, from a list on the wall; the absentees were noted 
down in a register. The school was divided into three classes. The 
first for those who had no notion of drawing; they were made to 
copy models, which were more or less difficult according to the 
abilities of each pupil. The second ‘for those who already have some 
principles’, or who had passed through the first class; they had to 
reproduce pictures ‘at sight, without tracing’, but considering only 
the drawing. In the third class, they learnt colouring and pastel 
drawing, and were introduced to the theory and practice of dyeing. 
The pupils performed individual tasks at regular intervals; each of 
these exercises, signed with the name of its author and date of 
execution, was handed in to the teacher; the best were rewarded; 

I -ambled together at the end of the year and compared, they made 
ossible to establish the progress, the present ability and the 
live place of each pupil; it was then decided which of them could 
, into the next class. A general book, kept by the teachers and 
r assistants, recorded from day to day the behaviour of the 
ils and everything that happened in the school; it was periodically 
tvn to an inspector (Gerspach, 1892). 

lie Gobelins school is only one example of an important pheno- 
ton: the development, in the classical period, of a new technique 
taking charge of the time of individual existences; for regulating 
relations of time, bodies and forces; for assuring an accumula- 
of duration; and for turning to ever-increased profit or use the 
/ement of passing time. How can one capitalize the time of 
viduals, accumulate it in each of them, in their bodies, in their 
e$ or in their abilities, in a way that is susceptible of use and 
trol? How can one organize profitable durations? The disciplines, 
c!» analyse space, break up and rearrange activities, must also be 
erstood as machinery for adding up and capitalizing time. This 
done in four ways, which emerge most clearly in military 


1. Divide duration into successive or parallel segments, each of 
which must end at a specific time. For example, isolate the period 
•f training and the period of practice; do not mix the instruction of 
remits and the exercise of veterans; open separate military schools 
•or the armed service (in 1764, the creation of the £cole Militairc in 
I ‘.iris, in 1776 the creation of twelve schools in the provinces);

recruit professional soldiers at the youngest possible age, take 
children, 'have them adopted by the nation, and brought up in 
special schools’ (Servan, J., 456); teach in turn posture, marching, 
the handling of weapons, shooting, and do not pass to another 
activity until the first has been completely mastered: 'One of the 
principal mistakes is to show a soldier every exercise at once’ 
('Reglcmcnt de 174} ..in short, break down time into separate 
and adjusted threads. 1. Organize these threads according to an 
analytical plan - successions of elements as simple as possible, 
combining according to increasing complexity. This presupposes 
that instruction should abandon the principle of analogical repeti¬ 
tion. In the sixteenth century, military exercise consisted above all 
in copying all or part of the action, and of generally increasing the 
soldier’s skill or strength; 7 in the eighteenth century, the instruction 
of the 'manual' followed the principle of the 'elementary' and not of 
the 'exemplary': simple gestures - the position of the fingers, the 
bend of the leg, the movement of the arms - basic elements for useful 
actions that also provide a general training in strength, skill, 
docility. 3. Finalize these temporal segments, decide on how long 
each will last and conclude it with an examination, which will have 
the triple function of showing whether the subject has reached the 
level required, of guaranteeing that each subject undergoes the same 
apprenticeship and of differentiating the abilities of each individual. 
When the sergeants, corporals, etc. ‘entrusted with the task of 
instructing the others, are of the opinion that a particular soldier is 
ready to pass into the first class, they will present him first to the 
officers of their company, who will carefully examine him; if they 
do not find him sufficiently practised, they will refuse to admit him; 
if, on the other hand, the man presented seems to them to be ready, 
the said officers will themselves propose him to the commanding 
officer of the regiment, who will see him if he thinks it necessary, 
and will have him examined by the senior officers. The slightest 
mistakes will be enough to have him rejected, and no one will be 
able to pass from the second class to the first until he has undergone 
this first examination’ (.Instruction par l'exercise de Vinfanterie , 14 
mai 1754)- 4 - Draw up scries of scries; lay down for each individual, 
according to his level, his seniority, his rank, the exercises that are 
suited to him; common exercises have a differing role and each 


Docile bodies 


difference involves specific exercises. At the end of each series, 
others begin, branch off and subdivide in turn. Thus each individual 
is caught up in a temporal series which specifically defines his level 
or his rank. It is a disciplinary polyphony of exercises: ‘Soldiers of 
the second class will be exercised every morning by sergeants, 
corporals, anspessades, lance-corporals. . . The lance-corporals will 
be exercised every Sunday by the head of the section .. .; the cor¬ 
porals and anspessades will be exercised every Tuesday afternoon 
by the sergeants and their company and these in turn on the after¬ 
noons of every second, twelfth and twenty-second day of each 
month by senior officers' (Instruction ...). 

It is this disciplinary time that was gradually imposed on peda¬ 
gogical practice - specializing the time of training and detaching it 
from the adult time, from the time of mastery; arranging different 
stages, separated from one another by graded examinations; drawing 
up programmes, each of which must take place during a particular 
stage and which involves exercises of increasing difficulty; qualifying 
individuals according to the way in which they progress through 
these scries. For the ‘initiatory’ time of traditional training (an over¬ 
all time, supervised by the master alone, authorized by a single 
examination), disciplinary time had substituted its multiple and 
progressive scries. A whole analytical pedagogy was being formed, 
meticulous in its detail (it broke down the subject being taught into 
its simplest elements, it hierarchized each stage of development into 
small steps) and also very precocious in its history (it largely antici¬ 
pated the genetic analyses of the ideologues, whose technical model 
it appears to have been). At die beginning of the eighteenth century, 
Demia suggested a division of the process of learning to read into 
seven levels: the first for those who arc beginning to learn the letters, 
the second for those who are learning to spell, the third for those 
who are learning to join syllables together to make words, the 
fourth for those who arc reading Latin in sentences or from punc¬ 
tuation to punctuation, the fifth for those who arc beginning to read 
French, the sixth for the best readers, the seventh for those who can 
read manuscripts. But, where there are a great many pupils, further 
subdivisions would have to be introduced; the first class would 
comprise four streams: one for those who are learning the ‘simple 
letters’; a second for those who are learning the ‘mixed’ letters; a 




Discipline 


third for those who are learning the abbreviated letters (a, e —); 
a fourth for those who arc learning the double letters (jf, ss, rt, st). 
The second class would be divided into three streams: for those who 
‘count each letter aloud before spelling the syllable, D.O ., DO'; for 
those 'who spell the most difficult syllables, such as bant , brand, 
spinx ’, etc. (Demia, 19-ao). Each stage in the combinatory of el¬ 
ements must be inscribed within a great temporal series, which is both 
a natural progress of the mind and a code for educative procedures. 

The ‘seriation’ of successive activities makes possible a whole 
investment of duration by power: the possibility of a detailed con¬ 
trol and a regular intervention (of differentiation, correction, 
punishment, elimination) in each moment of time; the possibility of 
characterizing, and therefore of using individuals according to the 
level in the series that they are moving through; the possibility of 
accumulating time and activity, of rediscovering them, totalized and 
usable in a final result, which is the ultimate capacity of an individual. 
Temporal dispersal is brought together to produce a profit, thus 
mastering a duration that would otherwise elude one’s grasp. Power 
is articulated directly onto time; it assures its control and guarantees 
its use. 

The disciplinary methods reveal a linear time whose moments are 
integrated, one upon another, and which is orientated towards a 
terminal, stable point; in short, an ’evolutive’ time. But it must be 
recalled that, at the same moment, the administrative and economic 
techniques of control reveal a social time of a serial, orientated, 
cumulative type: the discovery of an evolution in terms of'progress'. 
The disciplinary techniques reveal individual series: the discovery of 
an evolution in terms of 'genesis'. These two great 'discoveries’ 
of the eighteenth century - the progress of societies and the geneses 
of individuals - were perhaps correlative with the new techniques of 
power, and more specifically, with a new way of administering 
time and making it useful, by segmentation, seriation, synthesis and 
totalization. A macro- and a micro-physics of power made possible, 
not the invention of history (it had long had no need of that), but 
the integration of a temporal, unitary-, continuous, cumulative 
dimension in the exercise of controls and the practice of dominations. 
'Evolutive' historicity, as it was then constituted - and so profoundly 
that it is still self-evident for many today - is bound up with a mode 


Docile bodies 


of functioning of power. No doubt it is as if the ‘history-remember¬ 
ing’ of the chronicles, genealogies, exploits, reigns and deeds had 
long been linked to a modality of power. With the new techniques 
of subjection, the ‘dynamics’ of continuous evolutions tends to re¬ 
place the ‘dynasties’ of solemn events. 

In any case, the small temporal continuum of individuality- 
genesis certainly seems to be, like the individuality-cell or the 
individuality-organism, an effect and an object of discipline. And, at 
the centre of this seriation of time, one finds a procedure that is, for 
it, what the drawing up of ‘tables’ was for the distribution of 
individuals and cellular segmentation, or, again, what 'manoeuvre 
was for the economy of activities and organic control. This proce¬ 
dure is ‘exercise’. Exercise is that technique by which one imposes 
on the body tasks that are both repetitive and different, but always 
graduated. By bending behaviour towards a terminal state, exercise 
make> possible a perpetual characterization of the individual either 
in relation to this term, in relation to other individuals, or in relation 
to a type of itinerary. It thus assures, in the form of continuity and 
constraint, a growth, an observation, a qualification. Before adopt¬ 
ing this strictly disciplinary form, exercise had a long history: it is 
to be found in military, religious and university practices either as 
initiation ritual, preparatory ceremony, theatrical rehearsal or 
examination. Its linear, continuously progressive organization, its 
genetic development in time were, at least in the army and the 
school, introduced at a later date - and were no doubt of religious 
origin. In any case, the idea of an educational ‘programme’ that 
would follow the child to the end of his schooling and which would 
tnvolve from year to year, month to month, exercises of increasing 
complexity, first appeared, it seems, in a religious group, the 
Brothers of the Common Life (cf. Meir, 160 ff). Strongly inspired 
by Ruysbroek and Rhenish mysticism, they transposed certain of 
the spiritual techniques to education - and to the education not only 
of clerks, but also of magistrates and merchants: the theme of a per¬ 
fection towards which the exemplary master guides the pupil became 
with them that of an authoritarian perfection of the pupils by the 
teacher; the ever-increasing rigorous exercises that the ascetic life 
proposed became tasks of increasing complexity that marked the 
gradual acquisition of knowledge and good behaviour; the striving

Discipline 

of the whole community towards salvation became the collective, 
permanent competition of individuals being classified in relation to 
one another. Perhaps it was these procedures of community life and 
salvation that were the first nucleus of methods intended to produce 
individually characterized, but collectively useful aptitudes.* In its 
mystical or ascetic form, exercise was a way of ordering earthly time 
for the conquest of salvation. It was gradually, in the history of the 
West, to change direction while preserving certain of its character¬ 
istics; it served to economize the time of life, to accumulate it in a 
useful form and to exercise power over men through the mediation 
of time arranged in this way. Exercise, having become an element 
in the political technology of the body and of duration, does not 
culminate in a beyond, but tends towards a subjection that has never 
reached its limit. 

The composition of forces 

'Let us begin by destroying the old prejudice, according to which 
one believed one was increasing the strength of a troop by increasing 
its depth. All the physical laws of movement become chimeras when 
one wishes to adapt them to tactics.'* From the end of the seven¬ 
teenth century, the technical problem of infantry had been freed 
from the physical model of mass. In an army of pikes and muskets - 
slow, imprecise, practically incapable of selecting a target and taking 
aim - troops were used as a projectile, a wall or a fortress: 'the 
formidable infantry of the army of Spain'; the distribution of soldiers 
in this mass was carried out above all according to their seniority 
and their bravery; at the centre, with the task of providing weight 
and volume, of giving density to the body, were the least experi¬ 
enced; in front, at the angles and on the flanks, were the bravest or 
reputedly most skilful soldiers. In the course of the classical period, 
one passed over to a whole set of delicate articulations. The unit - 
regiment, battalion, section and, later, ‘division’ 10 - became a sort 
of machine with many parts, moving in relation to one another, in 
order to arrive at a configuration and to obtain a specific result. 
What were the reasons for this mutation? Some were economic: to 
make each individual useful and the training, maintenance, and 
arming of troops profitable; to give to each soldier, a precious unit. 


maximum efficiency'. But these economic reasons could become 
determinant only with a technical transformation: the invention of 
the rifle: 11 more accurate, more rapid than the musket, it gave 
greater value to the soldier's skill; more capable of reaching a par¬ 
ticular target, it made it possible to exploit fire-power at an indivi¬ 
dual level; and, conversely, it turned every soldier into a possible 
target, requiring by the same token greater mobility; it involved 
therefore the disappearance of a technique of masses in favour of an 
art that distributed units and men along extended, relatively flexible, 
mobile lines. Hence the need to find a whole calculated practice of 
individual and collective dispositions, movements of groups or 
isolated elements, changes of position, of movement from one dis¬ 
position to another; in short, the need to invent a machinery whose 
principle would no longer be the mobile or immobile mass, but a 
geometry of divisible segments whose basic unity was the mobile 
soldier with his rifle; 1 * and, no doubt, below the soldier himself, the 
minimal gestures, the elementary stages of actions, the fragments of 
spaces occupied or traversed. 

The same problems arose when it was a question of constituting 
a productive force whose effect had to be superior to the sum of 
elementary forces that composed it: 'The combined working-day 
produces, relatively to an equal sum of working-days, a greater 
quantity of use-values, and, consequently, diminishes the labour¬ 
time necessary for the production of a given useful effect. Whether 
the combined working-day, in a given case, acquires this increased 

C uctive power, because it heightens the mechanical force of 
ur, or extends its sphere of action over a greater space, or con¬ 
tracts the field of production relatively to the scale of production, 
or at the critical moment sets large masses of labour to work ... the 
special productive power of the combined working-day is, under 
all circumstances, the social productive power of labour, or the 
productive power of social labour. This power is due to cooperation 
itself (Marx, Capital , vol. i, 311-12). On several occasions, Marx 
stresses the analogy between the problems of the division of labour 
and those of military tactics. For example: ‘Just as the offensive 
power of a squadron of cavalry, or the defensive power of a regi¬ 
ment of infantry, is essentially different from the sum of the offen¬ 
sive or defensive powers of the individual cavalry or infantry

soldiers taken separately, so the sum total of the mechanical force 
exerted by isolated workmen differs from the social force that . 
developed, when many hands take pan simultaneously in one and 
the same undivided operation’ (Marx, Capital, vol. i, 308). 

Thus a new demand appears to which discipline must respond: to 
construct a machine whose effect will be maximized by the concerted 
articulation of the elementary parts of which it is composed. Disci¬ 
pline is no longer simply an art of distributing bodies, of extracting 
time from them and accumulating it, but of composing forces in 
order to obtain an efficient machine. This demand is expressed in 
several ways. 

1. The individual body becomes an element that may be placed, 
moved, articulated on others. Its bravery or its strength arc no 
longer the principal variables that define it; but the place it occupies, 
the interval it covers, the regularity, the good order according to 
which it operates its movements. The soldier is above all a fragment 
of mobile space, before he is courage or honour. Guibert describe' 
the soldier in the following way: ‘When he is under arms, he occu 
pies two feet along his greatest diameter, that is to say, taking him 
from one end to the other, and about one foot in his greatest thick¬ 
ness taken from the chest to the shoulders, to which one must add an 
interval of a foot between him and the next man; this gives two feet 
in all directions per soldier and indicates that a troop of infantry in 
battle occupies, either in its front or in its depth, as many steps as it 
has ranks’ (Guibert, 27). This is a functional reduction of the body. 
But it is also an insertion of this body-segment in a whole ensemble 
over which it is articulated. The soldier whose body has been trained 
to function part by part for particular operations must in turn form 
an element in a mechanism at another level. The soldiers will be 
instructed first ‘one by one, then two by two, then in greater 
numbers. . . For the handling of weapons, one will ascertain that, 
when the soldiers have been separately instructed, they will carry it 
out two by two, and then change places alternately, so that the one 
on the left may learn to adapt himself to the one on the right' 
('Ordonnance —’). The body is constituted as a part of a multi¬ 
segmentary machine. 

2. The various chronological series that discipline must combine 
to form a composite time are also pieces of machinery. The time of 


»ich must be adjusted to the time of the others in such a way that the 
maximum quantity of forces may be extracted from each and com- 
1 uned with the optimum result. Thus Servan dreamt of a military 
machine that would cover the whole territory of the nation and in 
which each individual would be occupied without interruption but 
tn a different way according to the evolutive segment, the genetic 
u-quence in which he finds himself. Military life would begin in 
. hildhood, when young children would be taught the profession of 
arms in ‘military manors’; it would end in these same manors when 
die veterans, right up to their last day, would teach the children, 

• xercise the recruits, preside over the soldiers’ exercises, supervise 
ihcm when they were carrying out works in the public interest, and 
Imally make order reign in the country, when the troops were fight¬ 
ing at the frontiers. There is not a single moment of life from which 
cannot extract forces, providing one knows how to differentiate 
and combine it with others. Similarly, one uses the labour of 
ildren and of old people in the great workshops; this is because 
have certain elementary capacities for which it is not necessary 
use workers w-ho have many other aptitudes; furthermore, they 
titute a cheap labour force; lastly, if they work, they are no 
ger at anyone's charge: 'Labouring mankind', said a tax collector 
an enterprise at Angers, ‘may find in this manufactory, from the 
of ten to old age, resources against idleness and the penury that 
Hows from it' (Marchegay, 360). But it was probably in primary 
ucation that this adjustment of different chronologies was to be 
ed out with most subtlety. From the seventeenth century to the 
uction, at the beginning of the nineteenth, of the Lancaster 
, the complex clockwork of the mutual improvement school 
built up cog by cog: first the oldest pupils were entrusted with 
tasks involving simple supervision, then of checking work, then of 
ing; in the end, all the time of all the pupils was occupied either 
ith teaching or with being taught. The school became a machine 
learning, in which each pupil, each level and each moment, if 
tly combined, were permanently utilized in the general pro¬ 
cess of teaching. One of the great advocates of the mutual improve¬ 
ment schools gives us some idea of this progress: ‘In a school of 360 
Idren, the master who would like to instruct each pupil in turn 
a session of three hours would not be able to give half a minute 



Discipline 

to each. By the new method, each of the 360 pupils writes, reads 01 
counts for two and a half hours’ (cf. Bernard). 

3. This carefully measured combination of forces requires j 
precise system of command. All the activity of the disciplined 
individual must be punctuated and sustained by injunctions whosr 
efficacity rests on brevity and clarity; the order does not need to be 
explained or formulated; it must trigger off the required behaviour 
and that is enough. From the master of discipline to him who i\ 
subjected to it the relation is one of signalization: it is a question not 
of understanding the injunction but of perceiving the signal and 
reacting to it immediately, according to a more or less artificial, 
prearranged code. Place the bodies in a little world of signals to each 
of which is attached a single, obligatory response: it is a technique 
of training, of dressage, that ‘despotically excludes in everything 
the least representation, and the smallest murmur'; the dis 
ciplined soldier 'begins to obey whatever he is ordered to do; hit 
obedience is prompt and blind; an appearance of indocility, the least 
delay would be a crime’ (Boussanclle, a). The training of school¬ 
children was to be carried out in the same way: few words, no 
explanation, a total silence interrupted only by signals - bells, clap¬ 
ping of hands, gestures, a mere glance from the teacher, or that little 
wooden apparatus used by the Brothers of the Christian Schools; it 
was called par excellence the 'Signal' and it contained in its mechanical 
brevity both the technique of command and the morality of obedi¬ 
ence. 'The first and principal use of the signal is to attract at once 
the attention of all the pupils to the teacher and to make them 
attentive to what he wishes to impart to them. Thus, whenever he 
wishes to attract the attention of the children, and to bring the 
exercise to an end, he will strike the signal once. Whenever a good 
pupil hears the noise of the signal, he will imagine that he is hearing 
the voice of the teacher or rather the voice of God himself calling 
him by his name. He will then partake of the feelings of the young 
Samuel, saying with him in the depths of his soul: "Lord, I am 
here." ' The pupil will have to have learnt the code of the signals 
and respond automatically to them. ‘When prayer has been said, 
the teacher will strike the signal at once and, turning to the child 
whom he wishes to read, he will make the sign to begin. To make a 
sign to stop to a pupil who is reading, he will strike the signal 


166 


Docile bodies 


once. . . To make a sign to a pupil to repeat when he has read 
badly or mispronounced a letter, a syllable or a word, he will strike 
the signal twice in rapid succession. If, after die sign had been made 
two or three times, the pupil who is reading does not find and repeat 
the word that he has badly read or mispronounced - because he has 
read several words beyond it before being called to order - the 
teacher will strike three times in rapid succession, as a sign to him to 
begin to read farther back; and he will continue to make the sign 
till die pupil finds the word which he has said incorrectly' (La Salle, 
Conduite ... 137-8; cf. also Dcmia, at). The mutual improvement 
school was to exploit still further this control of behaviour by the 
system of signals to which one had to react immediately. Even 
verbal orders were to function as elements of signalization: ‘Enter 
your benches. At the word enter , the children bring their right 
hands down on the table with a resounding thud and at the same 
time put one leg into the bench; at the words your benches they put 
the other leg in and sit down opposite their slates ... Take your 
slates . At the word take , the children, with their right hands, take 
hold of the string by which the slate is suspended from die nail 
before them, and, with their left hands, they grasp the slate in the 
middle; at the word slates , they unhook it and place it on the table’.* 3 
To sum up, it might be said that discipline creates out of the 
bodies it controls four types of individuality, or rather an individual¬ 
ity that is endowed with four characteristics: it is cellular (by the 
play of spatial distribution), it is organic (by the coding of activities), 
it is genetic (by the accumulation of time), it is combinatory (by the 
composition of forces). And, in doing so, it operates four great 
techniques: it draws up tables; it prescribes movements; it imposes 
exercises; lastly, in order to obtain the combination of forces, it 
arranges ‘tactics'. Tactics, the art of constructing, with located 
bodies, coded activities and trained aptitudes, mechanisms in which 
the product of the various forces is increased by their calculated 
combination are no doubt the highest form of disciplinary practice. 
In this knowledge, the eighteenth-century theoreticians saw the 
general foundation of all military practice, from the control and 
exercise of individual bodies to the use of forces specific to the most 
complex multiplicities. The architecture, anatomy, mechanics, 
economy of the disciplinary body: ‘In the eyes of most soldiers, 







Discipline 


tactics arc only a branch of the vast science of war; for me, they an 
the base of this science; they are this science itself, because the) 
teach how to constitute troops, order them, move them, get them to 
light; because tactics alone may make up for numbers, and handle 
the multitude; lastly, it will include knowledge of men, weapons, 
tensions, circumstances, because it is all these kinds of knowledge 
brought together that must determine those movements’ (Guibert, 
4). Or again: 'The term tactics .. . gives some idea of the respective 
position of the men who make up a particular troop in rela¬ 
tion to that of the different troops that make up an army, their 
movements and their actions, their relations with one another’ (Joly 
de Maizeroy, 2). 

It may be that war as strategy is a continuation of politics. But it 
must not be forgotten that ‘politics’ has been conceived as a con¬ 
tinuation, if not exactly and directly of war, at least of the military 
model as a fundamental means of preventing civil disorder. Politic-., 
as a technique of internal peace and order, sought to implement the 
mechanism of the perfect army, of the disciplined mass, of the docile, 1 
useful troop, of the regiment in camp and in the field, on manocu- I 
vres and on exercises. In the great eighteenth-century states, thr j 
army guaranteed civil peace no doubt because it was a real force, I 
an ever-threatening sword, but also because it was a technique and a I 
body of knowledge that could project their schema over the soci.il I 
body. If there is a politics-war series that passes through strategy, I 
there is an army-politics series that passes through tactics. It III 
strategy that makes it possible to understand warfare as a way ol I 
conducting politics between states; it is tactics that makes it possible 
to understand the army as a principle for maintaining the absence of I 
warfare in civil society. The classical age saw the birth of the grr.il I 
political and military strategy by which nations confronted each I 
other’s economic and demographic forces; but it also saw the birth I 
of meticulous military and political tactics by which the control of I 
bodies and individual forces was exercised within states. I \> 4 m 
'militaire ' - the military institution, military science, the mi/iiantw 
himself, so different from what was formerly characterized by 
term 'homme de guerre ’ - was specified, during this period, at fh*l 
point of junction between war and the noise of battle on the <>n« i 
hand, and order and silence, subservient to peace, on the other.1

Historians of ideas usually attribute the dream of a perfect society to 
the philosophers and jurists of the eighteenth century; but there was 
also a military dream of society; its fundamental reference was not to 
the state of nature, but to the meticulously subordinated cogs of a 


machine, not to the primal social contract, but to permanent coer¬ 
cions, not to fundamental rights, but to indefinitely progressive 
forms of training, not to the general will but to automatic docility. 

‘Discipline must be made national,’ said Guibert. 'The state that 
I depict will have a simple, reliable, easily controlled administration. 
It will resemble those huge machines, which by quite uncomplicated 
means produce great effects; the strength of this state will spring 
from its own strength, its prosperity from its own prosperity. Time, 

i roys all, will increase its power. It will disprove that 
udice by which we are made to imagine that empires are 
o an imperious law of decline and ruin' (Guibert, xxiii- 
hat Marx says about the army and forms of bourgeois 
tis letter to Engels, 25 September 1857). The Napoleonic 
s not far off and with it the form of state that was to 
ind, we must not forget, the foundations of which were 
ly by jurists, but also by soldiers, not only councillors of 
Iso junior officers, not only the men of the courts, but also 
' the camps. The Roman reference that accompanied this 
certainly bears with it this double index: citizens and 
, law and manoeuvres. While jurists or philosophers 
ng in the pact a primal model for the construction or 
tion of the social body, the soldiers and with them the 
i of discipline were elaborating procedures for the indivi- 
ollcctive coercion of bodies.

2. The means of correct training 


At the beginning of the seventeenth century, Walhausen spoke of 
‘strict discipline’ as an art of correct training. The chief function of 
the disciplinary power is to ‘train’, rather than to select and to levy; 
or, no doubt, to train in order to levy and select all the more. It does 
not link forces together in order to reduce them; it seeks to bind them 
together in such a way as to multiply and use them. Instead of bend¬ 
ing all its subjects into a single uniform mass, it separates, analyses, 
differentiates, carries its procedures of decomposition to the point of 
necessary and sufficient single units. It 'trains’ the moving, confused, 
useless multitudes of bodies and forces into a multiplicity of indivi¬ 
dual elements small, separate cells, organic autonomies, genetic 
identities and continuities, combinatory segments. Discipline 
‘makes’ individuals; it is the specific technique of a power that 
regards individuals both as objects and as instruments of its exercise. 
It is not a triumphant power, which because of its own excess can 
pride itself on its omnipotence; it is a modest, suspicious power, 
which functions as a calculated, but permanent economy. These 
are humble modalities, minor procedures, as compared with the 
majestic rituals of sovereignty or the great apparatuses of the state. 
And it is precisely they that were gradually to invade the major 
forms, altering their mechanisms and imposing their procedures.The 
legal apparatus was not to escape this scarcely secret invasion. The 
success of disciplinary power derives no doubt from the use of simple 
instruments; hierarchical observation, normalizing judgement and 
theircombination in a procedure that is specific to it.theexamination. 

Hierarchical observation 

The exercise of discipline presupposes a mechanism that coerces by 
means of observation; an apparatus in which the techniques that 


170 


The means of correct training 


make it possible to see induce effects of power, and in which, 
conversely, the means of coercion make those on whom they are 
applied clearly visible. Slowly, in the course of the classical age, we 
see the construction of those ‘observatories’ of human multiplicity 
for which the history of the sciences has so little good to say. Side 
by side with the major technology of the telescope, the lens and the 
light beam, which were an integral part of the new physics and cos¬ 
mology, there were the minor techniques of multiple and intersect¬ 
ing observations, of eyes that must see without being seen; using 
techniques of subjection and methods of exploitation, an obscure 
art of light and the visible was secretly preparing a new knowledge 
of man. 

These 'observatories' had an almost ideal model: the military 
camp - the short-lived, artificial city, built and reshaped almost at 
will; the seat of a power that must be all the stronger, but also all 
the more discreet, all the more effective and on the alert in that it is 
exercised over armed men. In the perfect camp, all pow'er would be 
exercised solely through exact observation; each gaze would form a 
part of the overall functioning of power. The old, traditional square 
plan was considerably refined in innumerable new projects. The 
geometry of the paths, the number and distribution of the tents, 
the orientation of their entrances, the disposition of files and ranks 
were exactly defined; the network of gazes that supervised one 
another was laid down: ‘In the parade ground, five lines are drawn 
up, the first is sixteen feet from the second; the others are eight feet 
from one another; and the last is eight feet from the arms depots. 
The arms depots are ten feet from the tents of the junior officers, 
immediately opposite the first tentpole. A company street is fifty-one 
feet wide. . . All tents are tw-o feet from one another. The tents of 
the subalterns are opposite the alleys of their companies. The rear 
tentpole is eight feet from the last soldiers’ tent and the gate is 
opposite the captains’ tent. . . The captains’ tents are erected 
opposite the streets of their companies. The entrance is opposite the 
companies themselves.’ 1 The camp is the diagram of a power that 
acts by means of general visibility. For a long time this model of the 
1amp or at least its underlying principle was found in urban develop¬ 
ment, in the construction of working-class housing estates, hospitals, 
asylums, prisons, schools: the spatial ‘nesting’ of hierarchized 


171 



Discipline 


surveillance. The principle was one of'embedding' (‘ cncastrement ’). 
The camp was to the rather shameful art of surveillance what the 
dark room was to the great science of optics. 

A whole problematic then develops: that of an architecture that 
is no longer built simply to be seen (as with the ostentation of 
palaces), or to observe the external space (cf. the geometry of for¬ 
tresses), but to permit an internal, articulated and detailed control - 
to render visible those who are inside it; in more general terms, an 
architecture that would operate to transform individuals: to act on 
those it shelters, to provide a hold on their conduct, to carry the 
effects of power right to them, to make it possible to know them, to 
alter them. Stones can make people docile and knowable. The old 
simple schema of confinement and enclosure - thick walls, a heavy 
gate that prevents entering or leaving - began to be replaced by the 
calculation of openings, of filled and empty spaces, passages and 
transparencies. In this way the hospital building was gradually 
organized as an instrument of medical action: it was to allow a better 
observation of patients, and therefore a better calibration of their 
treatment; the form of the buildings, by the careful separation of the 
patients, was to prevent contagions; lastly, the ventilation and the 
air that circulated around each bed was to prevent the deleterious 
vapours from stagnating around the patient, breaking down his 
humours and spreading the disease by their immediate effects. The 
hospital - which was to be built in the second half of the century , 
and for which so many plans were drawn up after the Hotel-Dicu 
was burnt down for the second time - was no longer simply the I 
roof under which penury and imminent death took shelter; it was, 
in its very materiality, a therapeutic operator. 

Similarly, the school buildi ng was to be a mechanism for training. I 
It was as a pedagogical machine that Paris-Duverney conceived the 
£co!e Militaire, right down to the minute details that he had imposed I 
on the architect, Gabriel. Train vigorous bodies, the imperative of I 
health; obtain competent officers, the imperative of qualification; I 
create obedient soldiers, the imperative of politics; prevent de 
bauchery and homosexuality, the imperative of morality. A fourfold I 
reason for establishing sealed compartments between individuals, 1 
but also apertures for continuous surveillance. The very building I 
of the £cole was to be an apparatus for observation; the rooms were ] 


172 


The means of correct training 


distributed along a corridor like a series of small cells; at regular 
intervals, an officer's quarters were situated, so that 'every ten pupils 
had an officer on each side'; the pupils were confined to their cells 
throughout the night; and Paris had insisted that ‘a window be 
placed on the corridor wall of each room from chest-level to within 
one or two feet of the ceiling. Not only is it pleasant to have such 
window's, but one would venture to say that it is useful, in several 
respects, not to mention the disciplinary reasons that may deter¬ 
mine this arrangement’ (quoted in Laulan, 117-18). In the dining¬ 
rooms was ‘a slightly raised platform for the tables of the inspectors 
of studies, so that they may see all the tables of the pupils of their 
divisions during meals’; latrines had been installed with half-doors, 
so that the supervisor on duty could see the head and legs of the 
pupils, and also with side walls sufficiently high 'that those inside 
cannot see one another'.* This infinitely scrupulous concern with 
surveillance is expressed in the architecture by innumerable petty 
mechanisms. These mechanisms can only be seen as unimportant 
if one forgets the role of this instrumentation, minor but flawless, 
in the progressive objectification and the ever more subtle partition¬ 
ing of individual behaviour. The disciplinary institutions secreted 
a machinery of control that functioned like a microscope of conduct; 
the fine, analytical divisions that they created formed around men 
an apparatus of observation, recording and training. How was one 
to subdivide the gaze in these observation machines? How was one 
to establish a network of communications between them? How was 
one so to arrange things that a homogeneous, continuous power 
would result from their calculated multiplicity? 

The perfect disciplinary apparatus would make it possible for a 

1 single gaze to see everything constantly. A central point would be 
both the source of light illuminating everything, and a locus of 
convergence for everything that must be known: a perfect eye that 
nothing would escape and a centre towards which all gazes would be 
turned. This is w'hat Ledoux had imagined when he built Arc-et- 
Scnans; all the buildings were to be arranged in a circle, opening on 

[ the inside, at the centre of which a high construction was to house 
the administrative functions of management, the policing functions 
"f surveillance, the economic functions of control and checking, the 
religious functions of encouraging obedience and work; from here 







Discipline 


all orders would come, all activities would be recorded, all offences 
perceived and judged; and this would be done immediately with no 
other aid than an exact geometry. Among all the reasons for the 
prestige that was accorded in the second half of the eighteenth 
century, to circular architecture, one must no doubt include the fact 
that it expressed a certain political utopia. 

But, the disciplinary gaze did, in fact, need relays. The pyramid 
was able to fulfil, more efficiently than the circle, two requirements: 
to be complete enough to form an uninterrupted network - con¬ 
sequently the possibility of multiplying its levels, and of distributing 
them over the entire surface to be supervised; and yet to be discreet 
enough not to weigh down with an inert mass on the activity to be 
disciplined, and not to act as a brake or an obstacle to it; to be 
integrated into the disciplinary mechanism as a function that in¬ 
creases its possible effects. It had to be broken down into smaller 
elements, but in order to increase its productive function: specify 
the surveillance and make it functional. 

This was the problem of the great workshops and factories, in 
which a new type of surveillance was organized. It was different 
from the one practised in the regimes of the manufactories, which 
had been carried out from the outside by inspectors, entrusted with 
the task of applying the regulations; what was now needed was an 
intense, continuous supervision; it ran right through the labour 
process; it did not bear - or not only - on production (the nature 
and quantity of raw materials, the type of instruments used, the 
dimensions and quality of the products); it also took into account 
the activity of the men, their skill, the way they set about their tasks, 
their promptness, their zeal, their behaviour. But it was also different 
from the domestic supervision of the master present beside his 
workers and apprentices; for it was carried out by clerks, superv isors 
and foremen. As the machinery of production became larger and 
more complex, as the number of workers and the division of labour 
increased, supervision became ever more necessary and more diffi¬ 
cult. It became a special function, which had nevertheless to form 
an integral part of the production process, to run parallel to it 
throughout its entire length. A specialized personnel became indis¬ 
pensable, constantly present and distinct from the workers: 'In the 
large factory, everything is regulated by the clock. The workers art 


>74 


The means of correct training 


treated strictly and harshly. The clerks, who are used to treating 
them with an air of superiority and command, which is really 
necessary with the multitude, treat them with severity or contempt; 
hence these workers either cost more or leave the factory soon after 
arrival' ( Encyclopedic , article on ‘Manufacture’). But, although the 
workers preferred a framework of a guild type to this new regime 
of surveillance, the employers saw that it was indissociable from the 
system of industrial production, private property and profit. At the 
scale of a factory, a great iron-works or a mine, 'the objects of 
expenditure are so multiplied, that the slightest dishonesty on each 
object would add up to an immense fraud, which would not only 
absorb the profits, but would lead to a loss of capital... the slightest 
incompetence, if left unnoticed and therefore repeated each day, may 
prove fatal to the enterprise to the extent of destroying it in a very 
short time'; hence the fact that only agents, directly dependent on 
the owner, and entrusted with this task alone would be able to sec 
'that not a sou is spent uselessly, that not a moment of the day is 
lost’; their role would be 'to supervise the workers, to inspect all the 
places of work, to inform the directors of everything that takes 
place’ (Cournol). Surveillance thus becomes a decisive economic 
operator both as an internal part of the production machinery and 
as a specific mechanism in the disciplinary power. ‘The work of 
directing, superintending and adjusting becomes one of the functions 
of capital, from the moment that the labour under the control of 
capital, becomes cooperative. Once a function of capital, it requires 
special characteristics' (Marx, Capital , vol. 1, 313). 

The same movement was to be found in the reorganization of 
elementary teaching: the details of surveillance were specified and 
it was integrated into the teaching relationship. The development 
of the parish schools, the increase in the number of their pupils, the 
absence of methods for regulating simultaneously the activity of a 
whole class, and the disorder and confusion that followed from this 
made it necessary to work out a system of supervision. In order to 
help the teacher, Batencour selected from among the best pupils a 
whole series of ‘officers’ - intendants, observers, monitors, tutors, 
reciters of prayers, writing officers, receivers of ink, almoners and 
visitors. The roles thus defined were of two kinds: the first involved 
material tasks (distributing ink and paper, giving alms to the poor. 


175 


Discipline 


reading spiritual texts on feast days, etc.); the second involved sur¬ 
veillance: the ‘observers must record who left his bench, who w-as 
talking, who did not have his rosary, or Book of Hours, who did not 
comport himself properly at mass, who committed an impure act, 
who indulged in idle talk or was unruly in the street’; the 'admoni- 
tors' were placed in charge of those ‘who talk or hum when studying 
their lessons and those who will not write and who waste their time 
in play’; the ‘visitors' called on the families of pupils who had been 
absent or who had committed serious offences. The 'intendants' 
supervised all the other officers. Only the ‘tutors’ had a pedagogical 
role: their task was to teach the pupils reading, two by two, in low 
tones (M.I.D.B., 68-83). A few decades later, Demia favoured 
hierarchy of the same type but almost all the functions of surveillance 
were duplicated by a pedagogical role: an assistant teacher taught thr 
holding of the pen, guided the pupil’s hand, corrected mistakes and 
at the same time 'marked down trouble-makers’; another assistant 
teacher had the same tasks in the reading class; the intendant who 
supervised the other officers and was in charge of behaviour in 
general also had the task uf ‘initialing newcomers into the custom 

of the school'; the dccurions got the pupils to recite their lessons and 
‘marked down’ those who did not know them. 5 We have here j 
sketch of an institution of the 'mutual' type in which three proce¬ 
dures are integrated into a single mechanism: teaching proper, tin 
acquisition of knowledge by the very practice of the pedagogical 
activity and a reciprocal, hierarchized observation. A relation ol 
surveillance, defined and regulated, is inscribed at the heart of t 
practice of teaching, not as an additional or adjacent part, but as a 
mechanism that is inherent to it and which increases its efficiency, 
Hierarchized, continuous and functional surveillance may not 
one of the great technical 'inventions’ of the eighteenth century, bt 
its insidious extension owed its importance to the mechanisms of 
power that it brought with it. By means of such surveillance, d 
ciplinary power became an 'integrated' system, linked from t 
inside to the economy and to the aims of the mechanism in which 
was practised. It was also organized as a multiple, automatic and 
anonymous power; for although surveillance rests on individuals, 
its functioning is that of a network of relations from top to botto 
but also to a certain extent from bottom to top and laterally; 1I1 



The means of correct training 


network ‘holds' the whole together and traverses it in its entirety 
with effects of power that derive from one another: supervisors, 
perpetually supervised. The power in the hierarchized surveillance 
of the disciplines is not possessed as a thing, or transferred as a 
property; it functions like a piece of machinery. And, although it is 
true that its pyramidal organization gives it a ‘head’, it is the appara¬ 
tus as a whole that produces ‘power’ and distributes individuals in 
this permanent and continuous field. This enables the disciplinary 
power to be both absolutely indiscreet, since it is everywhere and 
always alert, since by its very principle it leaves no zone of shade and 
constantly supervises the very individuals who are entrusted with 
the task of supervising; and absolutely ‘discreet’, for it functions 
permanently and largely in silence. Discipline makes possible the 
operation of a relational power that sustains itself by its own 
mechanism and which, for the spectacle of public events, substitutes 
the uninterrupted play of calculated gazes. Thanks to the techniques 
of surveillance, the 'physics' of power, the hold over the body, 
operate according to the laws of optics and mechanics, according 
a whole play of spaces, lines, screens, beams, degrees and without 
rse, in principle at least, to excess, force or violence. It is a 
wer that seems all the less 'corporal' in that it is more subtly 
ysicaP. 



'ormaliyinp judgement 

At the orphanage of the Chevalier Paulct, the sessions of the 
ibunal that met each morning gave rise to a whole ceremonial: 
'We found all the pupils drawn up as if for battle, in perfect align- 
t, immobility and silence. The major, a young gentleman of 
teen years, stood outside the ranks, sword in hand; at his com- 
, the troop broke ranks at the double and formed a circle. The 
ncil met in the centre; each officer made a report of his troop 
r the preceding twenty-four hours. The accused were allowed to 
nd themselves; witnesses were heard; the council deliberated 
, when agreement was reached, the major announced the number 
guilty, the nature of the offences and the punishments ordered. 

troop then marched off in the greatest order' (Pictet). At the 
art of all disciplinary systems functions a small penal mechanism. 




Discipline 


It enjoys a kind of judicial privilege with its own laws, its specific 
offences, its particular forms of judgement. The disciplines estab¬ 
lished an 'infra-penality'; they partitioned an area that the laws had 
left empty; they defined and repressed a mass of behaviour that the 
relative indifference of the great systems of punishment had allowed 
to escape. ‘On entering, the companions will greet one another ... 
on leaving, they must lock up the materials and tools that they have 
been using and also make sure that their lamps are extinguished’; 
'it is expressly forbidden to amuse companions by gestures or in any 
other way’; they must 'comport themselves honestly and decently'; 
anyone who is absent for more than five minutes without warning 
M. Oppenheim will be 'marked down for a half-day'; and in order 
to be sure that nothing is forgotten in this meticulous criminal 
justice, it is forbidden to do 'anything that may harm M. Oppenheim 
and his companions’ (Oppenheim, 29 September 1809). The work 
shop, the school, the army were subject to a whole micro-penality 
of time (latenesses, absences, interruptions of tasks), of activity 
(inattention, negligence, lack of zeal), of behaviour (impoliteness, 
disobedience), of speech (idle chatter, insolence), of the body 1 
('incorrect' attitudes, irregular gestures, lack of cleanliness), of 
sexuality (impurity, indecency). At the same time, by way of punish¬ 
ment, a whole series of subtle procedures was used, from light 
physical punishment to minor deprivations and petty humiliations. I 
It was a question both of making the slightest departures from cor- I 
rcct behaviour subject to punishment, and of giving a punitive I 
function to the apparently indifferent elements of the disciplinary I 
apparatus: so that, if necessary, everything might serve to punish I 
the slightest thing; each subject find himself caught in a punishable, I 
punishing universality. 'By the word punishment, one must under¬ 
stand everything that is capable of making children feel the offence 
they have committed, everything that is capable of humiliating them, 
of confusing them: ... a certain coldness, a certain indifference, .1 I 
question, a humiliation, a removal from office' (La Salle, Conduiit I 
..., 204-5)- 

2. But discipline brought with it a specific way of punishing that I 
was not only a small-scale model of the court. What is specific to I 
the disciplinary penality is non-observance, that which does not | 
measure up to the rule, that departs from it. The whole indefinite 1

The means of correct training 


domain of the non-conforming is punishable: the soldier commits 
an ‘offence’ whenever he docs not reach the level required; a pupil's 
'offence' is not only a minor infraction, but also an inability to carry 
out his tasks. The regulations for the Prussian infantry ordered that 
a soldier who had not correctly learnt to handle his rifle should be 
treated with the ‘greatest severity’. Similarly, 'when a pupil has not 
retained the catechism from the previous day, he must be forced to 
learn it, without making any mistake, and repeat it the following 
day; either he will be forced to hear it standing or kneeling, his 
hands joined, or he will be given some other penance’. 

Tlie order that the disciplinary punishments must enforce is of a 
mixed nature: it is an 'artificial' order, explicitly laid down by a law, 
j programme, a set of regulations. But it is also an order defined by 
natural and observable processes: the duration of an apprenticeship, 
the time taken to perform an exercise, the level of aptitude refer to 
a regularity that is also a rule. The children of the Christian Schools 
must never be placed in a 'lesson' of which they arc not yet capable, 
for this would expose them to the danger of being unable to learn 
.myihing; yci the duration of each stage is fixed by regulat ion and a 
pupil who at the end of three examinations has been unable to pass 
into the higher order must be placed, well in evidence, on the bench 
of the 'ignorant'. In a disciplinary regime punishment involves a 
double juridico-natural reference. 

3. Disciplinary punishment has the function of reducing gaps. 
It must therefore be essentially corrective. In addition to punish¬ 
ments borrowed directly from the judicial model (fines, flogging, 
solitary confinement), the disciplinary systems favour punishments 
that are exercise - intensified, multiplied forms of training, several 
times repeated: the regulations of 1766 for the infantry laid down 
that lance-corporals 'who show some negligence or lack of willing¬ 
ness will be reduced to the rank of private', and they will be able 
io rise to their former rank only after new exercises and a new 
examination. As Jean-Baptiste de La Salle put it: ‘Of all penances, 
impositions are the most honest for a teacher, the most advantageous 
for the parents’; they make it possible to ‘derive, from the very 
offences of the children, means of advancing their progress by 
correcting their defects'; to those, for example, 'who have not written 
•II that they were supposed to write or who have not applied 








Discipline 


themselves to doing it well, one can give some impositions to write 
out or to learn by heart’ (La Salle, Conduite . . 205). Disciplinary 

punishment is, in the main, isomorphic with obligation itself; it is 
not so much the vengeance of an outraged law as its repetition, its 
reduplicated insistence. So much so that the corrective effect expec¬ 
ted of it involves only incidentally expiation and repentance; it is 
obtained directly through the mechanics of a training. To punish 
is to exercise. 

4. In discipline, punishment is only one element of a double 
system: gratification-punishment. And it is this system that operate 
in the process of training and correction. The teacher ‘must avoid, 
as far as possible, the use of punishment; on the contrary, he must 
endeavour to make rewards more frequent than penalties, the lazy 
being more encouraged by the desire to be rewarded in the same 
way as the diligent than by the fear of punishment; that is why it 
will be very beneficial, when the teacher is obliged to use punish¬ 
ment, to win the heart of the child if he can before doing so’ (Demia, 
17). This mechanism with two elements makes possible a number 
of operations characteristic of disciplinary penality. First, the 
definition of behaviour and performance on the basis of the two 
opposed values of good and evil; instead of the simple division of 
the prohibition, as practised in penal justice, we have a distribu 
tion between a positive pole and a negative pole; all behaviour fall' 
in the field between good and bad marks, good and bad poinii 
Moreover, it is possible to quantify this field and work out an 
arithmetical economy based on it. A penal accountancy, constantly 
brought up to date, makes it possible to obtain the punitive balance* 
sheet of each individual. School ‘justice’, rudiments of which are tu 
be found in the army and the workshops, carried this system very 
far. The Brothers of the Christian Schools organized a whole mici •] 
economy of privileges and impositions: ‘Privileges may be used by 
pupils to gain exemption from penances which have been impeyfl 
on them. . . For example, a pupil may have been given four or mm 
catechism questions to copy out as an imposition; he will be able ml 
gain exemption from this penance by accumulating a certain numbed 
of privilege points; the teacher will assign the number for i-j< Ii 
question. . . Since privileges are worth a certain number of poinuJ 
the teacher also has others of less value, which serve as small chain'll 


The means of correct training 


for the first. For example, a child has an imposition from which he 
can redeem himself with six points; he earns a privilege of ten; 
he presents it to the teacher who gives him back four points, and so 
on’ (La Salle, Conduite ..., 156ff). What we have here is a transposi¬ 
tion of the system of indulgences. And by the play of this quantifica¬ 
tion, this circulation of awards and debits, thanks to the continuous 
calculation of plus and minus points, the disciplinary apparatuses 
hierarchized the ‘good’ and the ‘bad’ subjects in relation to one 
another. Through this micro-economy of a perpetual penality 
operates a differentiation that is not one of acts, but of individuals 
themselves, of their nature, their potentialities, their level or their 
value. By assessing acts with precision, discipline judges individuals 
in truth’; the penality that it implements is integrated into the cycle 
of knowledge of individuals. 

he distribution according to ranks or grade has a double role: 
s the gaps, hierarchizes qualities, skills and aptitudes; but it 
nishes and rewards. It is the penal functioning of setting in 
ind the ordinal character of judging. Discipline rewards 
by the play of awards, thus making it possible to attain 
ranks and places; it punishes by reversing this process. Rank 
‘serves as a reward or punishment. At the £cole Militairc, a 
x system of ‘honorary’ classification was developed; this 
ation was visible to all in the form of slight variations in 
a and more or less noble or ignoble punishments were 
;ed, as a mark of privilege or infamy, with the ranks thus 
ited. This classificatory, penal distribution was carried out 
t intervals by the reports that the officers, teachers and their 
,ts made, without consideration of age or grade, on ‘the 
qualities of the pupils’ and on ‘their universally recognized 
>ur'. The first class, known as the 'very good', were dis- 
ted by a silver epaulette; they enjoyed the honour of being 
as ‘purely military troops’; they therefore had a right to 
r punishment (arrests and, in serious cases, imprisonment). 
:ond class, 'the good’, wore an epaulette of red silk and silver; 
uld be arrested and condemned to prison, but also to the cage 
cneeling. The class of 'midioerts , had the right to an epaulette 
jvool; to the preceding penalties was added, if necessary, the 
; of sackcloth. The last class, that of the ‘bad’, was marked by 


Discipline 


The means of correct training 


an epaulette of brown wool; ‘the pupils of this class will be sut 
to all the punishments used in the Hotel or all those that are thought 
necessary, even solitary confinement in a dark dungeon’. To this 
was added, for a time, the ‘shameful’ class, for which special regula¬ 
tions were drawn up ‘so that those who belonged to it would always 
be separated from the others and would be dressed in sackcloth'. 
Since merit and behaviour alone must decide the place of the pupil, 
’those of the last two classes would be able to flatter themselves that 
they would be able to rise to the first two and bear its marks, when, 
by universal agreement, they will be recognized as having made 
themselves worthy of it by the change in their conduct and by their 
progress; and those of the top classes will similarly descend into the 
others if they become slack and if the various reports taken together 
are to their disadvantage and show that they no longer deserve the 
rewards and prerogatives of the higher classes. . The penal 
classification should tend to disappear. The ‘shameful* class existed 
only to disappear: 'In order to judge the kind of conversit 
undergone by pupils of the shameful class who behave well’, they 
were reintroduced into the other classes, and given back their 
uniforms; but they would remain with their comrades in infamy 
during meals and recreation; they would remain there if they did not 
continue to behave well; they 'would leave it absolutely, if their 
conduct was considered satisfactory both in this class and in this 
division’ (Archives nationales, MM 658, 30 March 1758 and MM 666, 
15 September 1763). This hierarchizing penality had, therefore, a 
double effect: it distributed pupils according to their aptitudes and 
their conduct, that is, according to the use that could be made of 
them when they left the school; it exercised over them a constant 
pressure to conform to the same model, so that they might all be 
subjected to 'subordination, docility, attention in studies and 
exercises, and to the correct practice of duties and all the parts of 
discipline’. So that they might all be like one another. 

In short, the art of punishing, in the regime of disciplinary power, 
is aimed neither at expiation, nor even precisely at repression. It 
brings five quite distinct operations into play: it refers individual 
actions to a whole that is at once a field of comparison, a space of 
differentiation and the principle of a rule to be followed. It differen¬ 
tiates individuals from one another, in terms of the following overall 


rule: that the rule be made to function as a minimal threshold, as 
an average to be respected or as an optimum towards which one 
must move. It measures in quantitative terms and hierarchizes in 
terms of value the abilities, the level, the ‘nature’ of individuals. It 
introduces, through this ‘value-giving’ measure, the constraint of 
a conformity that must be achieved. Lastly, it traces the limit 
that will define difference in relation to all other differences, the 
external frontier of the abnormal (the ‘shameful’ class of the £cole 
Militaire). The perpetual penality that traverses all points and 
supervises every instant in the disciplinary institutions compares, 
differentiates, hierarchizes, homogenizes, excludes. In short, it 
normalises. 

It is opposed, therefore, term by term, to a judicial penality 
whose essential function is to refer, not to a set of observable 
phenomena, but to a corpus of laws and texts that must be remem¬ 
bered; that operates not by differentiating individuals, but by 
specifying acts according to a number of general categories; not by 
hierarchizing, but quite simply by bringing into play the binary 
opposition of the permitted and the forbidden; not by homogeniz¬ 
ing, but by operating the division, acquired once and for all, of 
condemnation. The disciplinary mechanisms secreted a 'penality of 
ihe norm’, which is irreducible in its principles and functioning to 
the traditional penality of the law. The minor court that seems to sit 
permanently in the buildings of discipline, and which sometimes 
assumes the theatrical form of the great legal apparatus, must not 
mislead us: it does not bring, except for a few formal remnants, the 
mechanisms of criminal justice to the web of everyday existence; or 
at least that is not its essential role; the disciplines created - drawing 
on a whole series of very ancient procedures - a new functioning 
of punishment, and it was this that gradually invested the great 
external apparatus that it seemed to reproduce in either a modest or 
an ironic way. The juridico-anthropological functioning revealed in 
the whole history of modem penality did not originate in the super¬ 
imposition of the human sciences on criminal justice and in the 
requirements proper to this new rationality or to the humanism that 
it appeared to bring with it; it originated in the disciplinary tech¬ 
nique that operated these new mechanisms of normalizing 
judgement. 



Discipline 


The power of the Norm appears through the disciplines. Is this 
the new law of modern society? Let us say rather that, since the 
eighteenth century, it has joined other powers - the Law, the Word 
( Parole ) and the Text, Tradition - imposing new delimitations upon 
them. The Normal is established as a principle of coercion in teach¬ 
ing with the introduction of a standardized education and the 
establishment of the ecoles nor males (teachers’ training colleges); it 
is established in the effort to organize a national medical profession 
and a hospital system capable of operating general norms of health; 
it is established in the standardization of industrial processes and 
products (on this topic, one should refer to the important contribu¬ 
tion of Canguilhem, 171-91)- Like surveillance and with it, normal¬ 
ization becomes one of the great instruments of power at the end of 
the classical age. For the marks that once indicated status, privilege 
and affiliation were increasingly replaced - or at least supplemented 
- by a whole range of degrees of normality indicating membership 
of a homogeneous social body but also playing a part in classifica¬ 
tion, hicrarchization and the distribution of rank. In a sense, the 
power of normalization imposes homogeneity; but it individualizes 
by making it possible to measure gaps, to determine levels, to fix 
specialities and to render the differences useful by fitting them one 
to another. It is easy to understand how the power of the norm 
functions within a system of formal equality, since within a homo¬ 
geneity that is the rule, the norm introduces, as a useful imperative 
and as a result of measurement, all the shading of individual 
differences. 

The examination 

The examination combines the techniques of an observing hierarchy 
and those of a normalizing judgement. It is a normalizing gaze, a 
surveillance that makes it possible to qualify, to classify and to 
punish. It establishes over individuals a visibility through which 
one differentiates them and judges them. That is why, in all the 
mechanisms of discipline, the examination is highly ritualized. In it 
are combined the ceremony of power and the form of the experi¬ 
ment, the deployment of force and the establishment of truth. At the 
heart of the procedures of discipline, it manifests the subjection of 


The means of correct training 


those who are perceived as objects and the objectification of those 
who are subjected. The superimposition of the power relations and 
knowledge relations assumes in the examination all its visible 
brilliance. It is yet another innovation of the classical age that the 
historians of science have left unexplored. People write the history 
of experiments on those born blind, on wolf-children or under 
hypnosis. But who will write the more general, more fluid, but also 
more determinant history of the ‘examination’ - its rituals, its 
methods, its characters and their roles, its play of questions and 
answers, its systems of marking and classification? For in this 
slender technique are to be found a whole domain of knowledge, a 
whole type of power. One often speaks of the ideology that the 
human ‘sciences’ bring with them, in either discreet or prolix manner. 
But does their very technology, this tiny operational schema that 
has become so widespread (from psychiatry to pedagogy, from the 
diagnosis of diseases to the hiring of labour), this familiar method 
of the examination, implement, w ithin a single mechanism, power 
relations that make it possible to extract and constitute knowledge? 
It is not simply at the level of consciousness, of representations and 
in w'hat one thinks one knows, but at the level of what makes possible 
the knowledge that is transformed into political investment. 

One of the essential conditions for the epistemological ‘thaw’ of 
medicine at the end of the eighteenth century was the organization 
of the hospital as an ‘examining’ apparatus. The ritual of the visit 
was its most obvious form. In the seventeenth century, the physi¬ 
cian, coming from the outside, added his inspection to many other 
controls - religious, administrative, etc.; he hardly participated in 
the everyday administration of the hospital. Gradually, the visit 
became more regular, more rigorous, above all more extended: it 
became an ever more important part of the functioning of the 
hospital. In 1661, the physician of the Hotcl-Dieu of Paris was 
called upon to make a daily visit; in 1687, an ‘expectant’ physician 
was to examine, in the afternoon, certain seriously sick patients. 
The eighteenth-century regulations laid down the hours of the visit 
and its duration (at least two hours); they insisted on a rotation of 
physicians, which would guarantee visits every day ‘even on Easter 
Sunday’; at last, in 1771, a resident physician was appointed, charged 
with ‘providing all the services of his state, at night as well as in the 


185 








Discipline 


day, in the intervals between visits by an outside physician' (Registre 
des deliberations du bureau de THotel-Dieu). The old form of inspec¬ 
tion, irregular and rapid, was transformed into a regular observation 
that placed the patient in a situation of almost perpetual examina¬ 
tion. This had two consequences: in the internal hierarchy, the 
physician, hitherto an external element, begins to gain over the 
religious staff and to relegate them to a clearly specified, but subor¬ 
dinate role in the technique of the examination; the category of the 
'nurse' then appears; while the hospital itself, which was once little 
more than a poorhouse, was to become a place of training and of 
the correlation of knowledge; it represented a reversal therefore of 
the power relations and the constitution of a corpus of knowledge. 
The 'well-disciplined' hospital became the physical counterpart of 
the medical 'discipline'; this discipline could now abandon its textual 
character and take its references not so much from the tradition of 
author-authorities as from a domain of objects perpetually offered 
for examination. 

Similarly, the school became a sort of apparatus of uninterrupted 
examination that duplicated along its entire length the operation of 
teaching. It became less and less a question of jousts in which pupils 
pitched their forces against one another and increasingly a perpetual 
comparison of each and all that made it possible both to measure and 
to judge. The Brothers of the Christian Schools wanted their pupils 
to be examined every day of the week: on the first for spelling, on 
the second for arithmetic, on the third for catechism in the morning 
and for handwriting in the afternoon, etc. Moreover, there was to be 
an examination each month in order to pick out those who deserved 
to be submitted for examination by the inspector (La Salle, Con- 
duite ..., 160). From 1775, there existed at the £cole des Ponts et 
Chaussees sixteen examinations a year: three in mathematics, three 
in architecture, three in drawing, two in writing, one in stone¬ 
cutting, one in style, one in surveying, one in levelling, one in 
quantity surveying. The examination did not simply mark the end of 
an apprenticeship; it was one of its permanent factors; it was woven 
into it through a constantly repeated ritual of power. The examina¬ 
tion enabled the teacher, while transmitting his knowledge, to 
transform his pupils into a whole field of knowledge. Whereas the 
examination with which an apprenticeship ended in the guild 


186 


The means of correct training 


tradition validated an acquired aptitude - the 'master-work' 
authenticated a transmission of knowledge that had already been 
accomplished - the examination in the school was a constant 
, exchanger of knowledge; it guaranteed the movement of knowledge 
from the teacher to the pupil, but it extracted from the pupil a 
knowledge destined and reserved for the teacher. The school became 
the place of elaboration for pedagogy. And just as the procedure of 
the hospital examination made possible the epistemological 'thaw' of 
medicine, the age of the 'examining' school marked the beginnings 
I of a pedagogy that functions as a science. The age of inspections and 
endlessly repeated movements in the army also marked the develop¬ 
ment of an immense tactical knowledge that had its effect in the 
period of the Napoleonic wars. 

The examination introduced a whole mechanism that linked to a 
certain type of the formation of knowledge a certain form of the 
exercise of power. 

1. The examination transformed the economy of visibility into the 
exercise of power. Traditionally, power was what was seen, what was 
shown and what was manifested and, paradoxically, found the 
I principle of its force in the movement by which it deployed that 
force. Those on whom it was exercised could remain in the shade; 
they received light only from that portion of power that was 
conceded to them, or from the reflection of it that for a moment they 
carried. Disciplinary power, on the other hand, is exercised through 
its invisibility; at the same time it imposes on those whom it subjects 
a principle of compulsory visibility. In discipline, it is the subjects 
who have to be seen. Their visibility assures the hold of the power 
that is exercised over them. It is the fact of being constantly seen, 
of being able always to be seen, that maintains the disciplined 
individual in his subjection. And the examination is the technique 
by which power, instead of emitting the signs of its potency, instead 
of imposing its mark on its subjects, holds them in a mechanism of 
objectification. In this space of domination, disciplinary power 
manifests its potency, essentially, by arranging objects. The 
examination is, as it were, the ceremony of this objectification. 

Hitherto the role of the political ceremony had been to give rise 
to the excessive, yet regulated manifestation of power; it was a 
spectacular expression of potency, an 'expenditure', exaggerated and 

187 













Discipline 

coded, in which power renewed its vigour. It was always more or 
less related to the triumph. The solemn appearance of the sovereign 
brought with it something of the consecration, the coronation, the 
return from victory; even the funeral ceremony took place with all 
the spectacle of power deployed. Discipline, however, had its own 
type of ceremony. It was not the triumph, but the review, the 
‘parade’, an ostentatious form of the examination. In it the ‘subjects' 
were presented as ‘objects’ to the observation of a power that was 
manifested only by its gaze. They did not receive directly the mage 
of the sovereign power; they only felt its effects - in replica, as ii 
were - on their bodies, which had become precisely legible and 
docile. On 15 March 1666, Louis XIV took his first military review: 
18,000 men, 'one of the most spectacular actions of the reign', which 
was supposed to have 'kept all Europe in disquiet’. Several years 
later, a medal was struck to commemorate the event (cf. Jucquiot, 
50-54). It bears the exergue, 'Disciplina militaris ratitua ar.d the 
legend 'Prolusio ad victorias'. On the right, the king, right foot 
forward, commands the exercise itself with a stick. On the left, 
several ranks of soldiers are shown full face and aligned in depth; 
they have raised their right arms to shoulder height and are holding 
their rifles exactly vertical, their right legs are slightly forward and 
their left feet turned outwards. On the ground, lines intersect at 
right angles, to form, beneath the soldiers' feet, broad rectangles 
that serve as references for different phases and positions of the 
exercise. In the background is a piece of classical architecture. The 
columns of the palace extend those formed by the ranks of men and 
the erect rifles, just as the paving no doubt extends the lines of the 
exercise. But above the balustrade that crowns the building are 
statues representing dancing figures: sinuous lines, rounded ges¬ 
tures, draperies. The marble is covered with movements whose 
principle of unity is harmonic. The men, on the other hand, arc 
frozen into a uniformly repeated attitude of ranks and lines: a 
tactical unity. The order of the architecture, which frees at its sum¬ 
mit the figures of the dance, imposes its rules and its geometry on the 
disciplined men on the ground. The columns of power. 'Very good', 
Grand Duke Mikhail once remarked of a regiment, after having 
kept it for one hour presenting arms, 'only they breathe' (Kropotkin, 
8; I owe this reference to G. Canguilhem). 


The means of correct training 


Let us take this medal as evidence of the moment when, para¬ 
doxically but significantly, the most brilliant figure of sovereign 
power is joined to the emergence of the rituals proper to disciplinary 
power. The scarcely sustainable visibility of the monarch is turned 
into the unavoidable visibility of the subjects. And it is this inversion 
of visibility in the functioning of the disciplines that was to assure the 
. xercise of power even in its lowest manifestations. We are entering 
the age of the infinite examination and of compulsory objectification. 

2. The examination also introduces individuality into the field of 
documentation. The examination leaves behind it a whole meticulous 
archive constituted in terms of bodies and days. The examination 
that places individuals in a field of surveillance also situates them in 
4 network of writing; it engages them in a whole mass of documents 
that capture and fix them. The procedures of examination were 
accompanied at the same time by a system of intense registration 
and of documentary accumulation. A ‘power of writing' was con¬ 
stituted as an essential part in the mechanisms of discipline. On many 
points, it was modelled on the traditional methods of administrative 
documentation, though with particular techniques and important 
innovations. Some concerned methods of identification, signalling 
or description. This was the problem in the army, where it was 
necessary to track down deserters, avoid repeating enrolments, 
correct fictitious ‘information* presented by officers, know the ser¬ 
vices and value of each individual, establish with certainty 
the balance-sheet of those who had disappeared or died. It was the 
problem of the hospitals, where it was necessary to recognize 
the patients, expel shammers, follow the evolution of diseases, study 
the effectiveness of treatments, map similar cases and the beginnings 
of epidemics. It was the problem of the teaching establishments, 
where one had to define the aptitude of each individual, situate his 
level and his abilities, indicate the possible use that might be made 
of them: ‘The register enables one, by being available in time and 
place, to know the habits of the children, their progress in piety, 
in catechism, in the letters, during the time they have been at the 
School' (M.I.D.B., 64). 

Hence the formation of a whole series of codes of disciplinary 
individuality that made it possible to transcribe, by means of homo¬ 
genization the individual features established by the examination: 


189 


Discipline 


the physical code of signalling, the medical code of symptoms, the 
educational or military code of conduct or performance. These 
codes were still very crude, both in quality and quantity, but they 
marked a first stage in the ‘formalization’ of the individual within 
power relations. 

The other innovations of disciplinary writing concerned the 
correlation of these elements, the accumulation of documents, their 
seriation, the organization of comparative fields making it possible 
to classify, to form categories, to determine averages, to fix norms. 
The hospitals of the eighteenth century, in particular, w'ere great 
laboratories for scriptuary and documentary methods. The keeping 
of registers, their specification, the modes of transcription from one 
to the other, their circulation during visits, their comparison during 
regular meetings of doctors and administrators, the transmission of 
their data to centralizing bodies (cither at the hospital or at the 
central office of the poorhouses), the accountancy of diseases, cures, 
deaths, at the level of a hospital, a town and even of the nation as a 
whole formed an integral part of the process by which hospitals 
were subjected to the disciplinary regime. Among the fundamental 
conditions of a good medical ‘discipline’, in both senses of the w-ord, 
one must include the procedures of writing that made it possible to 
integrate individual data into cumulative systems in such a way that 
they were not lost; so to arrange things that an individual could be 
located in the general register and that, conversely, each datum of 
the individual examination might affect overall calculations. 

Thanks to the whole apparatus of writing that accompanied it, the 
examination opened up two correlative possibilities: firstly, the 
constitution of the individual as a describable, analysable object, not 
in order to reduce him to ‘specific’ features, as did the naturalists in 
relation to living beings, but in order to maintain him in his indivi¬ 
dual features, in his particular evolution, in his own aptitudes or 
abilities, under the gaze of a permanent corpus of knowledge; and, 
secondly, the constitution of a comparative system that made 
possible the measurement of overall phenomena, the description of 
groups, the characterization of collective facts, the calculation of the 
gaps between individuals, their distribution in a given ‘population’. 

These small techniques of notation, of registration, of constituting 
files, of arranging facts in columns and tables that are so familiar 


190 


The means of correct training 


1 * us now, were of decisive importance in the epistemological ‘thaw’ 
of the sciences of the individual. One is no doubt right to pose the 
Aristotelean problem: is a science of the individual possible and 
legitimate? A great problem needs great solutions perhaps. But 
there is the small historical problem of the emergence, towards the 
end of the eighteenth century, of what might generally be termed 
the ‘clinical’ sciences; the problem of the entry of the individual (and 
no longer the species) into the field of knowledge; the problem of 
the entry of the individual description, of the cross-examination, of 
anamnesis, of the ‘file’ into the general functioning of scientific dis¬ 
course. To this simple question of fact, one must no doubt give an 
answer lacking in ‘nobility’: one should look into these procedures 
of writing and registration, one should look into the mechanisms of 
examination, into the formation of the mechanisms of discipline, and 
of a new type of power over bodies. Is this the birth of the sciences 
of man? It is probably to be found in these ‘ignoble’ archives, where 
the modern play of coercion over bodies, gestures and behaviour 
has its beginnings. 

3. The examination, surrounded by all its documentary techniques, 
makes each individual a 'case': a case which at one and the same time 
constitutes an object for a branch of knowledge and a hold for a 
branch of power. The case is no longer, as in casuistry or juris¬ 
prudence, a set of circumstances defining an act and capable of 
modifying the application of a rule; it is the individual as he may be 
described, judged, measured, compared with others, in his very 
individuality; and it is also the individual who has to be trained or 
corrected, classified, normalized, excluded, etc. 

For a long time ordinary individuality - the everyday individual¬ 
ity of everybody - remained below the threshold of description. 
To be looked at, observed, described in detail, followed from day 
to day by an uninterrupted writing was a privilege. The chronicle of 
a man, the account of his life, his historiography, written as he lived 
out his life formed part of the rituals of his power. The disciplinary 
methods reversed this relation, lowered the threshold of describable 
individuality and made of this description a means of control and a 
method of domination. It is no longer a monument for future 
memory, but a document for possible use. And this new dcscrib- 
ability is all the more marked in that the disciplinary framework is

Discipline 


a strict one: the child, the patient, the madman, the prisoner, weir 
to become, with increasing ease from the eighteenth century and 
according to a curve which is that of the mechanisms of discipline, 
the object of individual descriptions and biographical account*. 
This turning of real lives into writing is no longer a procedure of] 
heroization; it functions as a procedure of objectification anc sub¬ 
jection. The carefully collated life of mental patients or delinquent* 
belongs, as did the chronicle of kings or the adventures of the great I 
popular bandits, to a certain political function of writing; but in a 
quite different technique of power. 

The examination as the fixing, at once ritual and ‘scientific’, of 
individual differences, as the pinning down of each individual in hi* 
own particularity (in contrast with the ceremony in which statu*, 
birth, privilege, function are manifested with all the spectacle of 
their marks) clearly indicates the appearance of a new modality of 
power in which each individual receives as his status his own indivi¬ 
duality, and in which he is linked by his status to the features, the 
measurements, the gaps, the ’marks' that characterize him and make 
him a ’case’. 

Finally, the examination is at the centre of the procedures that 
constitute the individual as effect and object of power, as effect and 
object of knowledge. It is the examination which, by combining 
hierarchical surveillance and normalizing judgement, assures thr 
great disciplinary functions of distribution and classification, maxi¬ 
mum extraction of forces and time, continuous genetic accumula 
tion, optimum combination of aptitudes and, thereby, the fabrication 
of cellular, organic, genetic and combinatory individuality. With it 
are ritualized those disciplines that may be characterized in a word 
by saying that they are a modality of power for which individual 
difference is relevant. 


The disciplines mark the moment when the reversal of the political 
axis of individualization - as one might call it - takes place. In 
certain societies, of which the feudal regime is only one example, 
it may be said that individualization is greatest w’here sovereignty 
is exercised and in the higher echelons of power. The more one 
possesses power or privilege, the more one is marked as an indivi¬ 
dual, by rituals, written accounts or visual reproductions. The ‘name’

■nd the genealogy that situate one within a kinship group, the 
performance of deeds that demonstrate superior strength and which 
•re immortalized in literary accounts, the ceremonies that mark the 
power relations in their very ordering, the monuments or donations 
that bring survival after death, the ostentation and excess of expendi- 
ture, the multiple, intersecting links of allegiance and suzerainty, 
•II these are procedures of an ‘ascending’ individualization. In a 
'lisciplinary regime, on the other hand, individualization is ‘descend¬ 
ing’: as power becomes more anonymous and more functional, 
ihose on whom it is exercised tend to be more strongly individual- 
ired; it is exercised by surveillance rather than ceremonies, by obser¬ 
vation rather than commemorative accounts, by comparative 
measures that have the ‘norm’ as reference rather than genealogies 
giving ancestors as points of reference; by 'gaps’ rather than by 
deeds. In a system of discipline, the child is more individualized 
than the adult, the patient more than the healthy man, the madman 
•nd the delinquent more than the normal and the non-delinquent. 
In each case, it is towards the first of these pairs that all the indivi¬ 
dualizing mechanisms are turned in our civilization; and when one 
wishes to individualize the healthy, normal and law-abiding adult, 
it is always by asking him how much of the child he has in him, 
what secret madness lies within him, what fundamental crime he 
has dreamt of committing. All the sciences, analyses or practices 
employing the root 'psycho-' have their origin in this historical 
reversal of the procedures of individualization. The moment that 
aw the transition from historico-ritual mechanisms for the forma¬ 
tion of individuality to the scientifico-disciplinary mechanisms, 
when the normal took over from the ancestral, and measurement 
from status, thus substituting for the individuality of the memorable 
man that of tile calculable man, that moment when the sciences of 
man became possible is the moment when a new technology of 
power and a new political anatomy of the body were implemented. 
And if from the early Middle Ages to the present day the 'adventure* 
is an account of individuality, the passage from the epic to the 
novel, from the noble deed to the secret singularity, from long 
exiles to the internal search for childhood, from combats to phan¬ 
tasies, it is also inscribed in the formation of a disciplinary society, 
fhe adventure of our childhood no longer finds expression in ‘le

bon petit Henri ', but in the misfortunes of‘little Hans’. The Romance 
of the Rose is written today by Mary Barnes; in the place of Lancelot, 
we have Judge Schreber. 

It is often said that the model of a society that has individual* 
as its constituent elements is borrowed from the abstract juridical 
forms of contract and exchange. Mercantile society, according to 
this view, is represented as a contractual association of isolated 
juridical subjects. Perhaps. Indeed, the political theory of the 
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries often seems to follow this 
schema. But it should not be forgotten that there existed at the same 
period a technique for constituting individuals as correlative ele¬ 
ments of power and knowledge. The individual is no doubt the 
fictitious atom of an ‘ideological’ representation of society; but be it 
also a reality fabricated by this specific technology of power that I 
have called ‘discipline’. We must cease once and for all to describe 
the effects of power in negative terms: it ‘excludes’, it 'represses', 
it ‘censors’, it ‘abstracts’, it ‘masks’, it ‘conceals’. In fact, power 
produces; it produces reality; it produces domains of objects and 
rituals of truth. The individual and the knowledge that may be 
gained of him belong to this production. 

Is it not somewhat excessive to derive such power from the petty 
machinations of discipline? How could they achieve effects of such 
scope? 


Panopiicism 


The following, according to an order published at the end of the 
wventeenth century, were the measures to be taken when the plague 
appeared in a town . 1 

First, a strict spatial partitioning: the closing of the town and its 
outlying districts, a prohibition to leave the town on pain of death, 
the killing of all stray animals; the division of the town into distinct 
quarters, each governed by an intendant. Each street is placed under 
the authority of a syndic, who keeps it under surveillance; if he 
leaves the street, he will be condemned to death. On the appointed 
day, everyone is ordered to stay indoors: it is forbidden to leave 
on pain of death. The syndic himself comes to lock the door of 
each house from the outside; he takes the key with him and hands 
it over to the intendant of the quarter; the intendant keeps it until 
the end of the quarantine. Each family will have made its own 
provisions; but, for bread and wine, small wooden canals arc set up 
between the street and the interior of the houses, thus allowing each 
person to receive his ration without communicating with the sup¬ 
pliers and other residents; meat, fish and herbs will be hoisted up 
into the houses with pulleys and baskets. If it is absolutely necessary 
to leave the house, it will be done in turn, avoiding any meeting. 
Only the intendants, syndics and guards will move about the 
streets and also, between the infected houses, from one corpse to 
another, the ’crows’, who can be left to die: these are ‘people of little 
substance who carry the sick, bury the dead, clean and do many vile 
and abject offices’. It is a segmented, immobile, frozen space. Each 
individual is fixed in his place. And, if he moves, he does so at the 
risk of his life, contagion or punishment. 

Inspection functions ceaselessly. The gaze is alert everywhere: ‘A 
considerable body of militia, commanded by good officers and men 









Discipline 




of substance', guards at the gates, at the town hall and in ev 
quarter to ensure the prompt obedience of the people and the 
absolute authority of the magistrates, 'as also to observe all di 
theft and extortion’. At each of the town gates there will be 
observation post; at the end of each street sentinels. Every day, t 
intendant visits the quarter in his charge, inquires whether 
syndics have carried out their tasks, whether the inhabitants hj 
anything to complain of; they ‘observe their actions’. Every da 
too, the syndic goes into the street for which he is respon 
stops before each house: gets all the inhabitants to appear at t 
windows (those who live overlooking the courtyard will be al 
cated a window looking onto the street at which no one but 
may show themselves); he calls each of them by name; inf< 
himself as to the state of each and every one of them - 'in w 
respect the inhabitants will be compelled to speak the truth u 
pain of death'; if someone does not appear at the window, thes 
must ask why: ‘In this way he will find out easily enough - 
dead or sick are being concealed.' Everyone locked up in 
cage, everyone at his window, answering to his name and sho 
himself when asked - it is the great review of the living and 
dead. 

This surveillance is based on a system of permanent registra 
reports from the syndics to the intendants, from the mtendants 
the magistrates or mayor. At the beginning of the 'lock up', the 
of each of the inhabitants present in the town is laid down, one 
one; this document bears ‘the name, age, sex of everyone, notwi 
standing his condition': a copy is sent to the intendant of the quat 
another to the office of the town hall, another to enable the sy 
to make his daily roll call. Everything that may be observed duri 
the course of the visits - deaths, illnesses, complaints, irregularities 
is noted down and transmitted to the intendants and magistrate 
The magistrates have complete control over medical treatment; they 
have appointed a physician in charge; no other practitioner may 
treat, no apothecary prepare medicine, no confessor visit a sick 
person without having received from him a written note 'to prevent 
anyone from concealing and dealing with those sick of the contagion, 
unknown to the magistrates'. The registration of the pathological 
must be constantly centralized. The relation of each individual to hit

■ 11 case and to his death passes through the representatives of power, 
ibe registration they make of it, the decisions they take on it. 

Five or six days after the beginning of the quarantine, the process 
ui purifying the houses one by one is begun. All the inhabitants are 
to leave; in each room ‘the furniture and goods' are raised 
m the ground or suspended from the air; perfume is poured 
ound the room; after carefully sealing the windows, doors and 
rven the keyholes with wax, the perfume is set alight. Finally, the 
tire house is closed while the perfume is consumed; those who 
ve carried out the work arc searched, as they were on entry, ‘in 
presence of the residents of the house, to see that they did not 
ve something on their persons as they left that they did not have 
n entering'. Four hours later, the residents are allowed to re-enter 
homes. 

This enclosed, segmented space, observed at every point, in 
a the individuals are inserted in a fixed place, in which the 
(lightest movements are supervised, in which all events are recorded, 
which an uninterrupted work of writing links the centre and 
periphery, in which power is exercised without division, according 
continuous hierarchical figure, in which each individual is con¬ 
stantly located, examined and distributed among the living beings, 
• be sick and the dead - all this constitutes a compact model of the 
disciplinary mechanism. The plague is met by order; its function is 
to sort out every possible confusion: that of the disease, which is 
transmitted when bodies are mixed together; that of the evil, which 
is increased when fear and death overcome prohibitions. It lays 
down for each individual his place, his body, his disease and his 
-loath, his well-being, by means of an omnipresent and omniscient 
power that subdivides itself in a regular, uninterrupted way even 
to the ultimate determination of the individual, of what characterizes 
him, of what belongs to him, of what happens to him. Against the 
plague, which is a mixture, discipline brings into play its power, 
which is one of analysis. A whole literary fiction of the festival grew 
up around the plague: suspended laws, lifted prohibitions, the 
Irenzy of passing time, bodies mingling together without respect, 
individuals unmasked, abandoning their statutory identity and the 
figure under which they had been recognized, allowing a quite 
different truth to appear. But there was also a political dream of the 


»97 










Discipline 


plague, which was exactly its reverse: not the collective festival: 
but strict divisions; not laws transgressed, but the penetration 
regulation into even the smallest details of everyday life through th« 
mediation of the complete hierarchy that assured the capillary furn < 
tioning of power; not masks that were put on and taken off, but the , 
assignment to each individual of his ‘true’ name, his ‘true’ place, hit I 
‘true’ body, his ‘true’ disease. The plague as a form, at once rcj| \ 
and imaginary, of disorder had as its medical and political correlative 1 
discipline. Behind the disciplinary mechanisms can be read the ' 
haunting memory of ‘contagions’, of the plague, of rebellions, 
crimes, vagabondage, desertions, people who appear and disappear, 
live and die in disorder. 

If it is true that the leper gave rise to rituals of exclusion, which to 
a certain extent provided the model for and general form of the 
great Confinement, then the plague gave rise to disciplinary pro- . 
jects. Rather than the massive, binary division between one set of 
people and another, it called for multiple separations, individualizing | 
distributions, an organization in depth of surveillance and control, I 
an intensification and a ramification of power. The leper was caught 
up in a practice of rejection, of exile-enclosure; he was left to his 1 
doom in a mass among which it was useless to differentiate; those ' 
sick of the plague were caught up in a meticulous tactical partition¬ 
ing in which individual differentiations were the constricting effects 
of a power that multiplied, articulated and subdivided itself; the great 
confinement on the one hand; the correct training on the other. 
The leper and his separation; the plague and its segmentations. The 
first is marked; the second analysed and distributed. The exile of 
the leper and the arrest of the plague do not bring with them the 
same political dream. The first is that of a pure community, the 
second that of a disciplined society. Two ways of exercising power 
over men, of controlling their relations, of separating out their 
dangerous mixtures. The plague-stricken town, traversed through¬ 
out with hierarchy, surveillance, observation, writing; the town 
immobilized by the functioning of an extensive power that bears in 
a distinct way over all individual bodies - this is the utopia of the 
perfectly governed city. The plague (envisaged as a possibility at 
least) is the trial in the course of which one may define ideally the 
exercise of disciplinary power. In order to make rights and laws 


Panopticism 


(unction according to pure theory, the jurists place themselves in 
i imagination in the state of nature; in order to sec perfect disciplines 
I functioning, rulers dreamt of the state of plague. Underlying dis- 
I .iplinary projects the image of the plague stands for all forms of 
I confusion and disorder; just as the image of the leper, cut off from 
I all human contact, underlies projects of exclusion. 

They are different projects, then, but not incompatible ones. We 
I vee them coming slowly together, and it is the peculiarity of the 
I nineteenth century that it applied to the space of exclusion of which 
I the leper was the symbolic inhabitant (beggars, vagabonds, madmen 
[ and the disorderly formed the real population) the technique of 
power proper to disciplinary partitioning. Treat ‘lepers’ as 'plague 
victims', project the subtle segmentations of discipline onto the 
I confused space of internment, combine it with the methods of analy- 
| tical distribution proper to power, individualize the excluded, but 
' use procedures of individualization to mark exclusion - this is what 
I was operated regularly by disciplinary power from the beginning 
of the nineteenth century in the psychiatric asylum, the penitentiary, 
the reformatory, the approved school and, to some extent, the 
hospital. Generally speaking, all the authorities exercising individual 
control function according to a double mode; that of binary division 
and branding (mad/sanc; dangcrous/harmless; normal/abnormal); 
and that of coercive assignment, of differential distribution (who he 
is; where he must be; how he is to be characterized; how he is to be 
recognized; how a constant surveillance is to be exercised over him 
in an individual way, etc.). On the one hand, the lepers arc treated as 
plague victims; the tactics of individualizing disciplines are imposed 
on the excluded; and, on the other hand, the universality of disci¬ 
plinary controls makes it possible to brand the ’leper’ and to bring 
into play against him the dualistic mechanisms of exclusion. The 
constant division between the normal and the abnormal, to which 
every individual is subjected, brings us back to our own time, by 
applying the binary branding and exile of the leper to quite different 
objects; the existence of a whole set of techniques and institutions 
for measuring, supervising and correcting the abnormal brings into 
play die disciplinary mechanisms to which the fear of the plague 
gave rise. All the mechanisms of power which, even today, are 
disposed around the abnormal individual, to brand him and to alter

Discipline 


Panopricism 


him, are composed of those two forms from which they distantly 
derive. 

Bentham’s Panopticon is the architectural figure of this composi¬ 
tion. We know the principle on which it was based: at the periphery, 
an annular building; at the centre, a tower; this tower is pierced with 
wide windows that open onto the inner side of the ring; the peri¬ 
pheric building is divided into cells, each of which extends the whole 
width of the building; they have two windows, one on the inside, 
corresponding to the windows of the tower; the other, on the out¬ 
side, allows the light to cross the cell from one end to the other. 
All that is needed, then, is to place a supervisor in a central tower 
and to shut up in each cell a madman, a patient, a condemned man, 
a worker or a schoolboy. By the effect of backlighting, one can 
observe from the tower, standing out precisely against the light, 
the small captive shadows in the cells of the periphery. They are 
like so many cages, so many small theatres, in which each actor is 
alone, perfectly individualized and constantly visible. The panoptic 
mechanism arranges spatial unities that make it possible to see con¬ 
stantly and to recognize immediately. In short, it reverses the prin¬ 
ciple of the dungeon; or rather of its three functions - to enclose, to 
deprive of light and to hide - it preserves only the first and elimin¬ 
ates the other two. Full lighting and the eye of a supervisor capture 
better than darkness, which ultimately protected. Visibility is a trap. 

To begin with, this made it possible - as a negative effect - to 
avoid those compact, swarming, howling masses that were to be 
found in places of confinement, those painted by Goya or described 
by Howard. Each individual, in his place, is securely confined to a 
cell from which he is seen from the front by the supervisor; but the 
side walls prevent him from coming into contact with his compan¬ 
ions. He is seen, but he does not sec; he is the object of information, 
never a subject in communication. The arrangement of his room, 
opposite the central tower, imposes on him an axial visibility; but 
the divisions of the ring, those separated cells, imply a lateral 
invisibility. And this invisibility is a guarantee of order. If the in¬ 
mates are convicts, there is no danger of a plot, an attempt at 
collective escape, the planning of new crimes for the future, bad 
reciprocal influences; if they are patients, there is no danger of 



contagion; if they are madmen thete is no risk of their committing 
violence upon one another; if they are schoolchildren, there is no 
copying, no noise, no chatter, no waste of time; if they are workers, 
there are no disorders, no theft, no coalitions, none of those dis¬ 
tractions that slow down the rate of work, make it less perfect or 
cause accidents. The crowd, a compact mass, a locus of multiple 
exchanges, individualities merging together, a collective effect, is 
abolished and replaced by a collection of separated individualities. 
From the point of view of the guardian, it is replaced by a multipli¬ 
city that can be numbered and supervised; from the point of view of 
the inmates, by a sequestered and observed solitude (Bcntham, 
60-64). 

Hence the major effect of the Panopticon: to induce in the inmate 
a state of conscious and permanent visibility that assures the auto¬ 
matic functioning of power. So to arrange things that the surveil¬ 
lance is permanent in its effects, even if it is discontinuous in its 
action; that the perfection of power should tend to render its actual 
exercise unnecessary; that this architectural apparatus should be a 
machine for creating and sustaining a power relation independent 
of the person who exercises it; in short, that the inmates should be 
caught up in a power situation of which they arc themselves the 
bearers. To achieve this, it is at once too much and too little that the 
prisoner should be constantly observed by an inspector: too little, 
for what matters is that he knows himself to be observed; too much, 
because he has no need in fact of being so. In view of this, Bcntham 
laid down the principle that power should be visible and unveri- 
fiable. Visible: the inmate will constantly have before his eyes the 
tall outline of the central tower from which he is spied upon. 
Unvcrifiable: the inmate must never know whether he is being 
looked at at any one moment; but he must be sure that he may always 
be so. In order to make the presence or absence of the inspector 
unverifiable, so that the prisoners, in their cells, cannot even see a 
shadow, Bcntham envisaged not only Venetian blinds on the 
windows of the central observation hall, but, on the inside, partitions 
that intersected the hall at right angles and, in order to pass from 
one quarter to the other, not doors but zig-zag openings; for the 
slightest noise, a gleam of light, a brightness in a half-opened door 
would betray the presence of the guardian.* The Panopticon is a 


200 


201 





Discipline 


machine for dissociating the see/being seen dyad: in the periph¬ 
eric ring, one is totally seen, without ever seeing; in the central 
tower, one sees everything without ever being seen. 3 

It is an important mechanism, for it automatizes 3nd disindivi* | 
dualizes power. Power has its principle not so much in a person I 
in a certain concerted distribution of bodies, surfaces, lights, gaze*; I 
in an arrangement whose internal mechanisms produce the relatiot 
in which individuals are caught up. The ceremonies, the rituals, the - 
marks by which the sovereign's surplus power was manifested are I 
useless. There is a machinery that assures dissymmetry, disequili- I 
brium, difference. Consequently, it does not matter who exercise* ■ 
power. Any individual, taken almost at random, can operate the * 
machine: in the absence of the director, his family, his friends, hi* 
visitors, even his servants (Bentham, 45). Similarly, it does not 
matter what motive animates him: the curiosity of the indiscreet, the 
malice of a child, the thirst for knowledge of a philosopher wh.i 
wishes to visit this museum of human nature, or the perversity of 
those who take pleasure in spying and punishing. The mo“ 
numerous those anonymous and temporary observers are, tl»e grea 
the risk for the inmate of being surprised and the greater his anxir 
awareness of being observed. The Panopticon is a marvello 
machine which, whatever use one may wish to put it to, prod 1 
homogeneous effects of power. 

A real subjection is born mechanically from a fictitious relation. 

So it is not necessary to use force to constrain the convict to good 
behaviour, the madman to calm, the worker to work, the schoolbos 
to application, the patient to the observation of the regulations. 
Bentham was surprised that panoptic institutions could be so light: 
there were no more bars, no more chains, no more heavy locks; all 
that was needed was that the separations should be clear and the 
openings well arranged. The heaviness of the old 'houses of security', 
with their fortress-like architecture, could be replaced by the simple, 
economic geometry of a 'house of certainty'. The efficiency of 
power, its constraining force have, in a sense, passed over to the 
other side - to the side of its surface of application. He who is 
subjected to a field of visibility, and who knows it, assumes responsi¬ 
bility for the constraints of power; he makes them play spontane¬ 
ously upon himself; he inscribes in himself the power relation in 


202 


Panopticism 


l which he simultaneously plays both roles; he becomes the principle 
>! his own subjection. By this very fact, the external power may 
throw off its physical weight; it tends to the non-corporal; and, the 
more it approaches this limit, the more constant, profound and 
l*rmanent are its effects: it is a perpetual victory that avoids any 
physical confrontation and which is always decided in advance. 

Bentham does not say whether he was inspired, in his project, by 
Le Vaux's menagerie at Versailles: the first menagerie in which the 
different elements are not, as they traditionally were, distributed in 
I a park (Loisel, 104-7). At the centre was an octagonal pavilion 
which, on the first floor, consisted of only a single room, the king’s 
ialon\ on every side large windows looked out onto seven cages 
(the eighth side was reserved for the entrance), containing different 
species of animals. By Bentham’s time, this menagerie had dis- 
«ppeared. But one finds in the programme of the Panopticon a 
vimilar concern with individualizing observation, with characteriza¬ 
tion and classification, with the analytical arrangement of space. The 
I Panopticon is a royal menagerie; the animal is replaced by man, 
I individual distribution by specific grouping and the king by the 
machinery of a furtive power. With this exception, the Panopticon 
also does the work of a naturalist. It makes it possible to draw up 
I differences: among patients, to observe the symptoms of each indivi¬ 
dual, without the proximity of beds, the circulation of miasmas, the 
effects of contagion confusing the clinical tables; among school¬ 
children, it makes it possible to observe performances (without 
there being any imitation or copying), to map aptitudes, to assess 
characters, to draw up rigorous classifications and, in relation to 
normal development, to distinguish 'laziness and stubbornness’ from 
'incurable imbecility’; among workers, it makes it possible to note 
the aptitudes of each worker, compare the time he takes to perform 
a task, and if they are paid by the day, to calculate their wages 
(Bentham, 60-64). 

So much for the question of observation. Bur the Panopticon was 
also a laboratory; it could be used as a machine to carry out experi¬ 
ments, to alter behaviour, to train or correct individuals. To experi¬ 
ment with medicines and monitor their effects. To try out different 
punishments on prisoners, according to their crimes and character, 
and to seek the most effective ones. To teach different techniques

simultaneously to the workers, to decide which is the best. To try 
out pedagogical experiments — and in particular to take up oner 
again the well-debated problem of secluded education, by using 
orphans. One would see what would happen when, in their six¬ 
teenth or eighteenth year, they were presented with other boys or.J 
girls; one could verify whether, as Helvetius thought, anyone could 
learn anything; one would follow ‘the genealogy of every observable 
idea’; one could bring up different children according to different 
systems of thought, making certain children believe that two and 
two do not make four or that the moon is a cheese, then put them 
together when they are twenty or twenty-five years old; one would 
then have discussions that would be worth a great deal more than 
the sermons or lectures on which so much money is spent; one 
would have at least an opportunity of making discoveries in the 
domain of metaphysics. The Panopticon is a privileged place for 
experiments on men, and for analysing with complete certainty thr 
transformations that may be obtained from them. The Panopticon 
may even provide an apparatus for supervising its own mechanisms. 
In this central tower, the director may spy on all the employees that 
he has under his orders: nurses, doctors, foremen, teachers, war¬ 
ders; he will be able to judge them continuously, alter their be¬ 
haviour, impose upon them the methods he thinks best; and it will 
even be possible to observe the director himself. An inspector 
arriving unexpectedly at the centre of the Panopticon will be able to 
judge at a glance, without anything being concealed from him, how 
the entire establishment is functioning. And, in any case, enclosed 
as he is in the middle of this architectural mechanism, is not thr 
director’s own fate entirely bound up with it? The incompetent 
physician who has allowed contagion to spread, the incompetent 
prison governor or workshop manager will be the first victims of an 
epidemic or a revolt. ’ "By every tie I could devise", said the master 
of the Panopticon, "my own fate had been bound up by me with 
theirs" ’ (Bentham, 177). The Panopticon functions as a kind of 
laboratory of power. Thanks to its mechanisms of observation, it 
gains in efficiency and in the ability to penetrate into men’s beha¬ 
viour; knowledge follows the advances of power, discovering new 
objects of knowledge over all the surfaces on which power is 
exercised.

Panopticism 


The plague-stricken town, the panoptic establishment - the 
lifferences are important. They mark, at a distance of a century and 
• half, the transformations of the disciplinary programme. In the 
lirst case, there is an exceptional situation: against an extraordinary 
evil, power is mobilized; it makes itself everywhere present and 
isible; it invents new mechanisms; it separates, it immobilizes, it 
partitions; it constructs for a time what is both a counter-city and 
the perfect society; it imposes an ideal functioning, but one that is 
reduced, in the final analysis, like the evil that it combats, to a simple 
dualism of life and death: that which moves brings death, and one 
kills that which moves. The Panopticon, on the other hand, must 
l>c understood as a generalizablc model of functioning; a way of 
defining power relations in terms of the everyday life of men. No 
doubt Bentham presents it as a particular institution, closed in upon 
itvolf. Utopias, perfectly closed in upon themselves, are common 
enough. As opposed to the ruined prisons, littered with mechanisms 
of torture, to be seen in Piranese’s engravings, the Panopticon 
presents a cruel, ingenious cage. The fact that it should have given 
rise, even in our own time, to so many variations, projected or 
realized, is evidence of the imaginary intensity that it has possessed 
for almost two hundred years. But the Panopticon must not be 
understood as a dream building: it is the diagram of a mechanism of 
power reduced to its ideal form; its functioning, abstracted front any 
obstacle, resistance or friction, must be represented as a pure archi¬ 
tectural and optical system: it is in fact a figure of political technology 
that may and must be detached from any specific use. 

It is polyvalent in its applications; it serves to reform prisoners, 
but also to treat patients, to instruct schoolchildren, to confine the 
insane, to supervise workers, to put beggars and idlers to work. It is 
a type of location of bodies in space, of distribution of individuals 
in relation to one another, of hierarchical organization, of disposi¬ 
tion of centres and channels of power, of definition of the instru¬ 
ments and modes of intervention of power, which can be implemen¬ 
ted in hospitals, workshops, schools, prisons. Whenever one is 
dealing with a multiplicity of individuals on whom a task or a 
particular form of behaviour must be imposed, the panoptic schema 
may be used. It is - necessary modifications apart - applicable ‘to 
all establishments whatsoever, in which, within a space not too large

it hat 


to be covered or commanded by buildings, a number of persons arr 
meant to be kept under inspection' (Bentham, 40; although Bentham 
takes the penitentiary house as his prime example, it is because it hat 
many different functions to fulfil - safe custody, confinement, 
solitude, forced labour and instruction). 

In each of its applications, it makes it possible to perfect the exer¬ 
cise of power. It does this in several ways: because it can reduce tl 
number of those who exercise it, while increasing the number 
those on whom it is exercised. Because it is possible to intervene 
any moment and because the constant pressure acts even before thr 
offences, mistakes or crimes have been committed. Because, in thcv 
conditions, its strength is that it never intervenes, it is exercisrd 
spontaneously and without noise, it constitutes a mechanism whose 
effects follow from one another. Because, without any physical 
instrument other than architecture and geometry, it acts directly on 
individuals; it gives ‘power of mind over mind’. The panoptic 
schema makes any apparatus of power more intense: it assures it> 
economy (in material, in personnel, in time); it assures its efficacity 
by its preventative character, its continuous functioning and it* 
automatic mechanisms. It is a way of obtaining from power 'in 
hitherto unexampled quantity', ‘a great and new instrument o! 
government ...; its great excellence consists in the great strength 
it is capable of giving to any institution it may be thought proper to 
apply it to' (Bentham, 66 ). 

It's a case of 'it’s easy once you’ve thought of it' in the political 
sphere. It can in fact be integrated into any function (education, 
medical treatment, production, punishment); it can increase thr 
effect of this function, by being linked closely with it; it can consti¬ 
tute a mixed mechanism in which relations of power (and of know¬ 
ledge) may be precisely adjusted, in the smallest detail, to the pro¬ 
cesses that are to be supervised; it can establish a direct proportion 
between surplus power' and 'surplus production'. In short, it 
arranges things in such a way that the exercise of power is not 
added on from the outside, like a rigid, heavy constraint, to the 
functions it invests, but is so subtly present in them as to in:rease 
their efficiency by itself increasing its ow n points of contact. The 
panoptic mechanism is not simply a hinge, a point of exchange 
between a mechanism of power and a function; it is a way of making 


Panopticism 


jxiwer relations function in a function, and of making a function 
lunction through these power relations. Bentham’s Preface to 
Panopticon opens w’ith a list of the benefits to be obtained from his 
'inspection-house': 'Morals reformed - health preserved - industry 
invigorated—instruction diffused—public burthens lightened— Economy 
K-ated, as it w’ere, upon a rock - the gordian knot of the Poor-Laws 
not cut, but untied - all by a simple idea in architecture!' (Bentham, 
) 9 )- 

Furthermore, the arrangement of this machine is such that its 
enclosed nature does not preclude a permanent presence from the 
outside: we have seen that anyone may come and exercise in the cen¬ 
tral tower the functions of surveillance, and that, this being the case, 
he can gain a clear idea of the way in which the surveillance is practised. 
In fact, any panoptic institution, even if it is as rigorously closed 
•. a penitentiary, may without difficulty be subjected to such irregu¬ 
lar and constant inspections: and not only by the appointed inspec- 
lors, but also by the public; any member of society will have the 
right to come and sec with his own eyes how the schools, hospitals, 
factories, prisons function. There is no risk, therefore, that the 
increase of power created by the panoptic machine may degenerate 
into tyranny; the disciplinary mechanism will be democratically 
controlled, since it will be constantly accessible 'to the great tribunal 
committee of the world’. 4 This Panopticon, subtly arranged so that 
an observer may observe, at a glance, so many different individuals, 
also enables everyone to come and observe any of the observers. 
The seeing machine was once a sort of dark room into which 
individuals spied; it has become a transparent building in which the 
exercise of power may be supervised by society as a whole. 

The panoptic schema, without disappearing as such or losing any 
of its properties, was destined to spread throughout the social body; 
its vocation was to become a generalized function. The plague- 
stricken town provided an exceptional disciplinary model: perfect, 
but absolutely violent; to the disease that brought death, power 
opposed its perpetual threat of death; life inside it was reduced to 
its simplest expression; it was, against the power of death, the meti¬ 
culous exercise of the right of the sword. The Panopticon, on the 
other hand, has a role of amplification; although it arranges power, 
although it is intended to make it more economic and more effective, 


207 




Discipline 






it does so not for power itself, nor for the immediate salvation 
threatened society: its aim is to strengthen the social forces 
increase production, to develop the economy, spread ed 
raise the level of public morality; to increase and multiply. 

How is power to be strengthened in such a way that, far fi 
impeding progress, far from weighing upon it with its rules 
regulations, it actually facilitates such progress? What intensi 
of power will be able at the same time to be a multiplicator of 
duction? How will power, by increasing its forces, be able to in 
those of society instead of confiscating them or impeding them? 
Panopticon’s solution to this problem is that the productive in 
of power can be assured only if, on the one hand, it can be ex 
continuously in the very foundations of society, in the subt 
possible way, and if, on the other hand, it functions outside 
sudden, violent, discontinuous forms that are bound up with 
exercise of sovereignty. The body of the king, with its s 
material and physical presence, with the force that he himself dep 
or transmits to some few others, is at the opposite extreme of 
new physics of power represented by panopticism; the domain 
panopticism is, on the contrary, that whole lower region, that 
of irregular bodies, with their details, their multiple move 
their heterogeneous forces, their spatial relations; what are requi 
are mechanisms that analyse distributions, gaps, scries, com 
tions, and which use instruments that render visible, rec 
differentiate and compare: a physics of a relational and multi 
power, which has its maximum intensity not in the person of 
king, but in the bodies that can be individualized by these rclati 
At the theoretical level, Bcntham defines another way of analyst 
the social body and the power relations that traverse it; in terms 
practice, he defines a procedure of subordination of bodies and fi 
that must increase the utility of power while practising the eco 
of the prince. Panopticism is the general principle of a new 'poli 
anatomy' whose object and end are not the relations of soverei 
but the relations of discipline. 

The celebrated, transparent, circular cage, with its high to 
powerful and knowing, may have been for Bentham a project ol » 
perfect disciplinary institution; but he also set out to show how out 
may ‘unlock’ the disciplines and get them to function in a diffused, 


208 


Panopticism 


" iliiple, polyvalent way throughout the whole social body. These 
tUciplines, which the classical age had elaborated in specific, 

t latively enclosed places - barracks, schools, workshops - and 
hose total implementation had been imagined only at the limited 
id temporary scale of a plague-stricken town, Bentham dreamt of 
•nsforming into a network of mechanisms that would be cvcry- 
herc and always alert, running through society without interrup- 
on in space or in time. The panoptic arrangement provides the 
formula for this generalization. It programmes, at the level of an 
rIrtnentary and easily transferable mechanism, the basic functioning 
fa society penetrated through and through with disciplinary 
1 .acchanisms. 


There are two images, then, of discipline. At one extreme, the 
itcipline-blockadc, the enclosed institution, established on the 
;es of society, turned inwards towards negative functions: 
resting evil, breaking communications, suspending time. At the 
other extreme, with panopticism, is the discipline-mechanism: a 
functional mechanism that must improve the exercise of power by 
making it lighter, more rapid, more effective, a design of subtle 
..►crcion for a society to come. The movement from one project 
to the other, from a schema of exceptional discipline to one of 
' a generalized surveillance, rests on a historical transformation: 

the gradual extension of the mechanisms of discipline throughout 
I the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, their spread throughout the 
I whole social body, the formation of what might be called in general 
I tlic disciplinary society. 

A whole disciplinary generalization - the Benthamite physics of 
I power represents an acknowledgement of this - had operated 
I throughout the classical age. rite spread of disciplinary institutions, 
I whose network was beginning to cover an ever larger surface and 
I occupying above all a less and less marginal position, testifies to 
I this: what was an islet, a privileged place, a circumstantial measure, 
I or a singular model, became a general formula; the regulations 
[ characteristic of the Protestant and pious armies of William of 
Orange or of Gustavus Adolphus were transformed into regulations 
for all the armies of Europe; the model colleges of the Jesuits, or the 
schools of Batencour or Demia, following the example set by Sturm, 


209 


Discipline 


provided the outlines for the general forms of educational dis 
cipline; the ordering of the naval and military hospitals provided 
the model for the entire reorganization of hospitals in the eighteenth 
century. 

But this extension of the disciplinary institutions was no doubt 
only the most visible aspect of various, more profound processes. 

I. The functional inversion of the disciplines. At first, they were 
expected to neutralize dangers, to fix useless or disturbed popula¬ 
tions, to avoid the inconveniences of over-large assemblies; now 
they were being asked to play a positive role, for they were becom 
ing able to do so, to increase the possible utility of individ 
Military discipline is no longer a mere means of preventing looting, 
desertion or failure to obey orders among the troops; it has become 
a basic technique to enable the army to exist, not as an assembled 
crowd, but as a unity that derives from this very unity an increase 
in its forces; discipline increases the skill of each individual, co¬ 
ordinates these skills, accelerates movements, increases fire pDwer, 
broadens the fronts of attack without reducing their vigour, in¬ 
creases the capacity for resistance, etc. The discipline of the work 
shop, while remaining a way of enforcing respect for the regulations 
and authorities, of preventing thefts or losses, tends to increase 
aptitudes, speeds, output and therefore profits; it still exerts a moral 
influence over behaviour, but more and more it treats actions in 
terms of their results, introduces bodies into a machinery, forces into 
an economy. When, in the seventeenth century, the provincial 
schools or the Christian elementary schools were founded, the 
justifications given for them were above all negative: those poor 
who were unable to bring up their children left them ‘in ignorance 
of their obligations: given the difficulties they have in earning a 
living, and themselves having been badly brought up, they are 
unable to communicate a sound upbringing that they themselves 
never had’; this involves three major inconveniences: ignorance of 
God, idleness (with its consequent drunkenness, impurity, larceny, 
brigandage); and the formation of those gangs of beggars, always 
ready to stir up public disorder and ‘virtually to exhaust the funds 
of the Hotel-Dieu’ (Demia, 60-61). Now, at the beginning of the 
Revolution, the end laid down for primary education was to be, 
among other things, to 'fortify', to 'develop the body’, to prepare 


210 


Panopticism 


the child ‘for a future in some mechanical work’, to give him 'an 
observant eye, a sure hand and prompt habits’ (Talleyrand’s Report 
to the Constituent Assembly, 10 September 1791, quoted by Leon, 
106). The disciplines function increasingly as techniques for making 
useful individuals. Hence their emergence from a marginal position 
on the confines of society, and detachment from the forms of 
exclusion or expiation, confinement or retreat. Hence the slow 
loosening of their kinship with religious regularities and enclosures. 
Hence also their rooting in the most important, most central and 
most productive sectors of society. They become attached to some 
of the great essential functions: factory production, the transmission 
of knowledge, the diffusion of aptitudes and skills, the war-machine. 
Hence, too, the double tendency one sees developing throughout 
the eighteenth century to increase the number of disciplinary insti¬ 
tutions and to discipline the existing apparatuses. 

2. The swarming of disciplinary mechanisms. While, on the one 
hand, the disciplinary establishments increase, their mechanisms 
have a certain tendency to become ‘dc-institutionalized’, to emerge 
from the closed fortresses in which they once functioned and to 
circulate in a ‘free’ state; the massive, compact disciplines arc broken 
down into flexible methods of control, which may be transferred 
and adapted. Sometimes the closed apparatuses add to their internal 
and specific function a role of external surveillance, developing 
around themselves a whole margin of lateral controls. Thus the 
Christian School must not simply train docile children; it must also 
make it possible to supervise the parents, to gain information as to 
their way of life, their resources, their piety, their morals. The 
school tends to constitute minute social observatories that penetrate 
even to the adults and exercise regular supervision over them: the 
bad behaviour of the child, or his absence, is a legitimate pretext, 
according to Demia, for one to go and question the neighbours, 
especially if there is any reason to believe that the family will not 
tell the truth; one can then go and question the parents themselves, 
to find out whether they know their catechism and the prayers, 
whether they are determined to root out the vices of their children, 
how many beds there are in the house and what the sleeping arrange¬ 
ments are; the visit may end with the giving of alms, the present of a 
religious picture, or the provision of additional beds (Demia, 39-40). 

211 



Discipline 


Similarly, the hospital is increasingly conceived of as a bav 
the medical observation of the population outside; after die bumuM 
down of the Hotcl-Dieu in 177a, there were several demand* ii* 
the large buildings, so heavy and so disordered, should bereplai™ 
by a series of smaller hospitals; their function would be to take ■ 
the sick of the quarter, but also to gather information, to be jU«| 
to any endemic or epidemic phenomena, to open dispensaries, id 
give advice to the inhabitants and to keep the authorities informs 
of the sanitary state of the region. 5 

One also sees the spread of disciplinary procedures, not in f|fl 
form of enclosed institutions, but as centres of observation ilw 
seminated throughout society. Religious groups and charity 
organizations had long played this role of‘disciplining’ the popultt 
tion. From the Counter-Reformation to the philanthropy of ihf 
July monarchy, initiatives of this type continued to increase; thelff 
aims were religious (conversion and moralizaiion), economic (im| . 
and encouragement to work) or political (the struggle against dl» 
content or agitation). One has only to cite by way of example tli#; 
regulations for the charity associations in the Paris parishes. Tit# 
territory to be covered was divided into quarters and cantons aiul 
the members of the associations divided themselves up along tltf( 
same lines. These members had to visit their respective areal, 
regularly. 'They will strive to eradicate places of ill-repute, tobaccfl'P 
shops, life-classes, gaming house, public scandals, blasphemy, im¬ 
piety, and any other disorders that may come to their knowledge.' 
They will also have to make individual visits to the poor; and tin 
information to be obtained is laid down in regulations: the stability 
of the lodging, knowledge of prayers, attendance at the sacrament*, 
knowledge of a trade, morality (and 'whether they have not fallen 
into poverty through their own fault’); lastly, ‘one must learn by 
skilful questioning in what way they behave at home. Whether then- 
is peace between them and their neighbours, whether they arc care¬ 
ful to bring up their children in the fear of God ... whether they do 
not have their older children of different sexes sleeping together and 
with them, whether they do not allow licentiousness and cajolery 
in their families, especially in their older daughters. If one has any 
doubts as to whether they are married, one must ask to sec their 
marriage certificate’. 5

Panopticism 



L I The scate-control of the mechanisms of discipline. In England, it 
private religious groups that carried out, for a long time, the 
^pin;tions of social discipline (cf. Radzinovitz, 203-14); in France, 
M )„ lU gh a pan of this role remained in the hands of parish guilds 
Br - harity associations, another - and no doubt the most important 
V|rt - was very soon taken over by the police apparatus. 

The organization of a centralized police had long been regarded, 
n by contemporaries, as the most direct expression of royal 
Ivolutism; the sovereign had wished to have ‘his own magistrate to 
<>m he might directly entrust his orders, his commissions, inten¬ 
ons, and who was entrusted with the execution of orders and 
[jtiders under the King's private seal’ (a note by Duval, first secretary 
| the police magistrature, quoted in Funck-Brentano, 1). In effect, 
in* taking over a number of pre-existing functions - the search for 
^jriminals, urban surveillance, economic and political supervision - 
the police magistrates and the magistrature-general that presided 
ver them in Paris transposed them into a single, strict, administra- 
ve machine: ‘AH the radiations of force and information that 
read from the circumference culminate in the magistrate-general. 
,.. It is he who operates all the wheels that together produce order 
id harmony. The effects of his administration cannot be better 
compared than to the movement of the celestial bodies’ (Des 
lAsarts, 344 and 528). 

But, although the police as an institution were certainly organized 
in the form of a state apparatus, and although this was certainly 
linked directly to the centre of political sovereignty, the type of 
power that it exercises, the mechanisms it operates and the elements 
10 which it applies them are specific. It is an apparatus that must be 
coextensive with the entire social body and not only by the extreme 
limits that it embraces, but by the minuteness of the details it is 
concerned with. Police power must bear ‘over everything’: it is not 
however the totality of the state nor of the kingdom as visible and 
invisible body of the monarch; it is the dust of events, actions, 
behaviour, opinions - 'everything that happens’; 7 the police are 
[ concerned with ‘those things of every moment', those ‘unimportant 
things’, of which Catherine II spoke in her Great Instruction 
I (Supplement to the Instruction for the drawing up of a new code , 1769, 
article 535). With the police, one is in the indefinite world of a 


Discipline 


supervision that seeks ideally to reach the most elementary particle, | 
the most passing phenomenon of the social body: 'The ministry of 
the magistrates and police officers is of the greatest importance; the 
objects that it embraces are in a sense definite, one may perceivf" 
them only by a sufficiently detailed examination’ (Delamare, un 
numbered Preface): the infinitely small of political power. 

And, in order to be exercised, this power had to be given t 
instrument of permanent, exhaustive, omnipresent surveilla 
capable of making all visible, as long as it could itself remain inv 
ble. It had to be like a faceless gaze that transformed the whe 
social body into a field of perccptidn: thousands of eyes postear 
everywhere, mobile attentions ever on the alert, a long, hierarchized " 
network which, according to Le Maire, comprised for Paris th# 
forty-eight commissaires , the twenty inspecteurs , then the 'observen'- 
who were paid regularly, the 'basses mouches ’, or secret agents, win 
were paid by the day, then the informers, paid according to the j 
done, and finally the prostitutes. And this unceasing observat 
had to be accumulated in a scries of reports and registers; threughe 
the eighteenth century, an immense police text increasingly covet 
society by means of a complex documentary organization (on t 
police registers in the eighteenth century, cf. Chassaigne). Ar 
unlike the methods of judicial or administrative writing, what w 
registered in this way were forms of behaviour, attitudes, possib 
ties, suspicions - a permanent account of individuals’ behaviour. 

Now, it should be noted that, although this police supervisioi 
was entirely 'in the hands of the king', it did not function in a sin ' 
direction. It was in fact a double-entry system: it had to correspc 
by manipulating the machinery of justice, to the immediate wi„ 
of the king, but it was also capable of responding to solicitatio 
from below; the celebrated lettres de cachet , or orders under 
king's private seal, which were long the symbol of arbitrary roya 
rule and which brought detention into disrepute on political 
grounds, were in fact demanded by families, masters, local notables, 
neighbours, parish priests; and their function was to punish l>\ 
confinement a whole infra-penality, that of disorder, agitation, di* 
obedience, bad conduct; those things that Ledoux wanted to exclude 
from his architecturally perfect city and which he called 'offences of 
non-survcillance’. In short, the eighteenth-century police added « 


ft 


214 


Panopticism 


disciplinary function to its role as the auxiliary of justice in the 
pursuit of criminals and as an instrument for the political supervision 
of plots, opposition movements or revolts. It was a complex func¬ 
tion since it linked the absolute power of the monarch to the lowest 
levels of power disseminated in society; since, between these differ- 
nit, enclosed institutions of discipline (workshops, armies, schools), 
it extended an intermediary network, acting where they could not 
intervene, disciplining the non-disciplinary spaces; but it filled in 
die gaps, linked them together, guaranteed with its armed force an 
interstitial discipline and a meta-discipline. 'By means of a wise 
police, the sovereign accustoms the people to order and obedience’ 
(Vattel, 162). 

Die organization of the police apparatus in the eighteenth century 
unctioned a generalization of the disciplines that became co-exten- 
live with the state itself. Although it was linked in the most explicit 
way with everything in the royal power that exceeded the exercise 
( if regular justice, it is understandable why the police offered such 
flight resistance to the rearrangement of the judicial power; and why 
It has not ceased to impose its prerogatives upon it, with ever- 
increasing weight, right up to the present day; this is no doubt 
because it is the secular arm of the judiciary; but it is also because, 
to a far greater degree than the judicial institution, it is identified, 
by reason of its extent and mechanisms, with a society of the 
| disciplinary type. Yet it would be wrong to believe that the dis¬ 
ciplinary functions were confiscated and absorbed once and for all 
by a state apparatus. 

’Discipline’ may be identified neither with an institution nor with 
in apparatus; it is a type of power, a modality for its exercise, com¬ 
prising a whole set of instruments, techniques, procedures, levels of 
application, targets; it is a ‘physics’ or an ‘anatomy’ of power, a 
technology. And it may be taken over cither by 'specialized' institu¬ 
tions (the penitentiaries or 'houses of correction’ of the nineteenth 
icntury), or by institutions that use it as an essential instrument for a 
particular end (schools, hospitals), or by pre-existing authorities 
I that find in it a means of reinforcing or reorganizing their internal 
mechanisms of power (one day we should show how intra-familial 
relations, essentially in the parcnts-^hildren cell, have become 'disci¬ 
plined', absorbing since the classical age external schemata, first 








Discipline 




educational and military, then medical, psychiatric, psychological, 
which have made the family the privileged locus of emergence for 
the disciplinary question of the normal and the abnormal); or by 
apparatuses that have made discipline their principle of internal 
functioning (the disciplinarization of the administrative apparatus 
from the Napoleonic period), or finally by state apparatuses whose 
major, if not exclusive, function is to assure that discipline reign* 
over society as a whole (the police). 

On the whole, therefore, one can speak of the formation of a 
disciplinary society in this movement that stretches from thr 
enclosed disciplines, a sort of social ‘quarantine’, to an indefinitely 
generalizable mechanism of ‘panopticism’. Not because the disci¬ 
plinary modality of power has replaced all the others; but becaus< 
it has infiltrated the others, sometimes undermining them, but 
serving as an intermediary between them, linking them together, 
extending them and above all making it possible to bring the effect* 
of power to the most minute and distant elements. It assures an 
infinitesimal distribution of the power relations. 

A few years after Bcntham, Julius gave this society its birth 
certificate (Julius, 384-6). Speaking of the panoptic principle, he 
said that there was much more there than architectural ingenuity: 
it was an event in the ‘history of the human mind’. In appearance, 
it is merely the solution of a technical problem; but, through it, a 
whole type of society emerges. Antiquity had been a civilization of 
spectacle. 'To render accessible to a multitude of men the inspection 
of a small number of objects’: this was the problem to which the 
architecture of temples, theatres and circuses responded. With 
spectacle, there was a predominance of public life, the intensity of 
festivals, sensual proximity. In these rituals in which blood flowed, 
society found new vigour and formed for a moment a single great 
body. The modem age poses the opposite problem: To procure 
for a small number, or even for a single individual, the instantaneous 
view of a great multitude.’ In a society in which the principal 
elements are no longer the community and public life, but, on the 
one hand, private individuals and, on the other, the state, relations 
can be regulated only in a form that is the exact reverse of the 
spectacle: ‘It was to the modem age, to the ever-growing influence 
of the state, to its ever more profound intervention in all the details 



Panopticism 


and all the relations of social life, that was reserved the task of 
increasing and perfecting its guarantees, by using and directing 
towards that great aim the building and distribution of buildings 
intended to observe a great multitude of men at the same time.’ 

Julius saw as a fulfilled historical process that which Bentham had 
described as a technical programme. Our society is one not of 
spectacle, but of surveillance; under the surface of images, one 
invests bodies in depth; behind the great abstraction of exchange, 
there continues the meticulous, concrete training of useful forces; 
the circuits of communication are the supports of an accumulation 
and a centralization of knowledge; the play of signs defines the 
anchorages of power; it is not that the beautiful totality of the 
individual is amputated, repressed, altered by our social order, it is 
rather that the individual is carefully fabricated in it, according to a 
whole technique of forces and bodies. We are much less Greeks than 
we believe. We are neither in the amphitheatre, nor on the stage, 
but in the panoptic machine, invested by its effects of power, which 
we bring to ourselves since we are part of its mechanism. The 
importance, in historical mythology, of the Napoleonic character 
probably derives from the fact that it is at the point of junction of 
the monarchical, ritual exercise of sovereignty and the hierarchical, 
permanent exercise of indefinite discipline. He is the individual who 
looms over everything with a single gaze which no detail, however 
minute, can escape: 'You may consider that no part of the Empire 
is without surveillance, no crime, no offence, no contravention that 
remains unpunished, and that the eye of the genius who can en¬ 
lighten all embraces the whole of this vast machine, without, how¬ 
ever, the slightest detail escaping his attention’ (Treilhard, 14). At 
the moment of its full blossoming, the disciplinary society still 
assumes with the Emperor the old aspect of the power of spectacle. 
As a monarch who is at one and the same time a usurper of the 
ancient throne and the organizer of the new state, he combined 
into a single symbolic, ultimate figure the whole of the long process 
by which the pomp of sovereignty, the necessarily spectacular 
manifestations of power, were extinguished one by one in the daily 
exercise of surveillance, in a panopticism in which the vigilance of 
intersecting gazes was soon to render useless both the eagle and 
the sun.

Discipline 




The formation of the disciplinary society is connected with a ( 
number of broad historical processes - economic, juridico-political j 
and, lastly, scientific - of which it forms part. 

i. Generally speaking, it might be said that the disciplines ai— 
techniques for assuring the ordering of human multiplicities. It' 
true that there is nothing exceptional or even characteristic in chi 
every system of power is presented with the same problem. But tl 
peculiarity of the disciplines is that they try to define in relation 
the multiplicities a tactics of power that fulfils three criteria: firstl 
to obtain the exercise of power at the lowest possible cost (econor 
ally, by the low expenditure it involves; politically, by its discretic 
its low exteriorization, its relative invisibility, the little resistance 
arouses); secondly, to bring the effects of this social power to th- 
maximum intensity and to extend them as far as possible, withe 
either failure or interval; thirdly, to link this ‘economic' growth 
power with the output of the apparatuses (educational, military, 
industrial or medical) within which it is exercised; in short, 
increase both the docility and the utility of all the elements of the 
system. This triple objective of the disciplines corresponds to 
well-known historical conjuncture. One aspect of this conjunctur 
was the large demographic thrust of the eighteenth century; an - 
increase in the floating population (one of the primary objects of 1 
discipline is to fix; it is an anti-nomadic technique); a change of 
quantitative scale in the groups to be supervised or manipulated 
(from the beginning of the seventeenth century to the eve of the 
French Revolution, the school population had been increasing 
rapidly, as had no doubt the hospital population; by the end of the 
eighteenth century, the peace-time army exceeded 200,000 men). 
The other aspect of the conjuncture was the growth in the apparatus 
of production, which was becoming more and more extended and 
complex; it was also becoming more costly and its profitability had 
to be increased. The development of the disciplinary methods 
corresponded to these two processes, or rather, no doubt, to the new 
need to adjust their correlation. Neither the residual forms of feudal 
power nor the structures of the administrative monarchy, nor the 
local mechanisms of supervision, nor the unstable, tangled mass 
they all formed together could carry out this role: they were 
hindered from doing so by the irregular and inadequate extension of 


IM 



218 


Panopticism 


1 heir network, by their often conflicting functioning, but above all 
by the ‘costly’ nature of the power that was exercised in them. It 
was costly in several senses: because directly it cost a great deal to 
the Treasury; because the system of corrupt offices and farmed-out 
taxes weighed indirectly, but very heavily, on the population; 
t>ecause the resistance it encountered forced it into a cycle of per¬ 
petual reinforcement; because it proceeded essentially by levying 
(levying on money or products by royal, seigniorial, ecclesiastical 
taxation; levying on men or time by corvlts of press-ganging, by 
locking up or banishing vagabonds). The development of the disci¬ 
plines marks the appearance of elementary techniques belonging to 
a quite different economy: mechanisms of power which, instead of 
proceeding by deduction, are integrated into the productive effi¬ 
ciency of the apparatuses from within, into the growth of this 
efficiency and into the use of what it produces. For the old principle 
of 'levying-violence', which governed the economy of power, the 
disciplines substitute the principle of 'mildness-production-profit’. 
These are the techniques that make it possible to adjust the multi¬ 
plicity of men and the multiplication of the apparatuses of produc¬ 
tion (and this means not only ‘production’ in the strict sense, but 
also the production of knowledge and skills in the school, the 
production of health in the hospitals, the production of destructive 
force in the army). 

In this task of adjustment, discipline had to solve a number of 
problems for which the old economy of power was not sufficiently 
equipped. It could reduce the inefficiency of mass phenomena: 
reduce what, in a multiplicity, makes it much less manageable than 
a unity; reduce what is opposed to the use of each of its elements 
and of their sum; reduce everything that may counter the advantages 
of number. That is why discipline fixes; it arrests or regulates 
movements; it clears up confusion; it dissipates compact groupings 
of individuals wandering about the country in unpredictable ways; 
it establishes calculated distributions. It must also master all the 
forces that are formed from the very constitution of an organized 
multiplicity; it must neutralize the effects of counter-power that 
spring from them and which form a resistance to the power that 
wishes to dominate it: agitations, revolts, spontaneous organizations, 
coalitions - anything that may establish horizontal conjunctions. 







Discipline 


Hence the fact that the disciplines use procedures of partitioning 
and verticality, that they introduce, between the different elements 
at the same level, as solid separations as possible, that they define 
compact hierarchical networks, in short, that they oppose to the 
intrinsic, adverse force of multiplicity the technique of the continu¬ 
ous, individualizing pyramid. They must also increase the particular 
utility of each element of the multiplicity, but by means that are the 
most rapid and the least costly, that is to say, by using the multi¬ 
plicity itself as an instrument of this growth. Hence, in order to 
extract from bodies the maximum time and force, the use of those 
overall methods known as time-tables, collective training, exercises, 
total and detailed surveillance. Furthermore, the disciplines must 
increase the effect of utility proper to the multiplicities, so that each 
is made more useful than the simple sum of its elements: it is in 
order to increase the utilizable effects of the multiple that the disci¬ 
plines define tactics of distribution, reciprocal adjustment of bodies, 
gestures and rhythms, differentiation of capacities, reciprocal co¬ 
ordination in relation to apparatuses or tasks. Lastly, the disciplines 
have to bring into play the power relations, not above but inside 
the very texture of the multiplicity, as discreetly as possible, as well 
articulated on the other functions of these multiplicities and also in 
the least expensive way possible: to this correspond anonymous 
instruments of power, coextensive with the multiplicity that they 
regiment, such as hierarchical surveillance, continuous registration, 
perpetual assessment and classification. In short, to substitute for a 
power that is manifested through the brilliance of those who exercise 
it, a power that insidiously objectifies those on whom it is applied; 
to form a body of knowledge about these individuals, rather than to 
deploy the ostentatious signs of sovereignty. In a word, the disci¬ 
plines are the ensemble of minute technical inventions that made it 
possible to increase the useful size of multiplicities by decreasing the 
inconveniences of the power which, in order to make them useful, 
must control them. A multiplicity, whether in a workshop or a 
nation, an army or a school, reaches the threshold of a discipline 
when the relation of the one to the other becomes favourable. 

If the economic take-off of the West began with the techniques 
that made possible the accumulation of capital, it might perhaps be 
said that the methods for administering the accumulation of men 


220 


Panopticism 


made possible a political take-off in relation to the traditional, ritual, 
costly, violent forms of power, which soon fell into disuse and were 
superseded by a subtle, calculated technology' of subjection. In fact, 
the two processes - the accumulation of men and the accumulation 
of capital - cannot be separated; it would not have been possible 
to solve the problem of the accumulation of men without the growth 
of an apparatus of production capable of both sustaining them and 
using them; conversely, the techniques that made the cumulative 
multiplicity of men useful accelerated the accumulation of capital. 
At a less general level, the technological mutations of the apparatus 
of production, the division of labour and the elaboration of the 
disciplinary techniques sustained an ensemble of very close relations 
(cf. Marx, Capital , vol. i, chapter XIII and the very interesting 
analysis in Guerry and Deleule). Each makes the other possible and 
necessary; each provides a model for the other. The disciplinary 
pyramid constituted the small cell of power within which the 
separation, coordination and supervision of tasks was imposed and 
made efficient; and analytical partitioning of time, gestures and 
bodily forces constituted an operational schema that could easily be 
transferred from the groups to be subjected to the mechanisms of 
production; the massive projection of military methods onto indus¬ 
trial organization was an example of this modelling of the division 
of labour following the model laid down by the schemata of power. 
But, on the other hand, the technical analysis of the process of 
production, its 'mechanical’ breaking-down, were projected onto 
the labour force whose task it was to implement it: the constitution 
of those disciplinary machines in which the individual forces that 
they bring together arc composed into a whole and therefore 
increased is the effect of this projection. Let us say that discipline 
is the unitary technique by which the body is reduced as a 'political' 
force at the least cost and maximized as a useful force. The growth 
of a capitalist economy gave rise to the specific modality of disci¬ 
plinary power, whose general formulas, techniques of submitting 
forces and bodies, in short, 'political anatomy’, could be operated 
in the most diverse political regimes, apparatuses or institutions. 

2. The panoptic modality of power - at the elementary, tech¬ 
nical, merely physical level at which it is situated - is not under 
the immediate dependence or a direct extension of the great 


221 





Discipline 

juridico-political structures of a society; it is nonetheless not 
absolutely independent. Historically, the process by which the 
bourgeoisie became in the course of the eighteenth century the politi¬ 
cally dominant class was masked by the establishment of an explicit, 
coded and formally egalitarian juridical framework, made possible 
by the organization of a parliamentary, representative regime. But 
the development and generalization of disciplinary mechanisms 
constituted the other, dark side of these processes. The general 
juridical form that guaranteed a system of rights that were egali¬ 
tarian in principle was supported by these tiny, everyday, physical 
mechanisms, by all those systems of micro-power that are essentially 
non-egalitarian and asymmetrical that we call the disciplines. And 
although, in a formal way, the representative regime makes it pos¬ 
sible, directly or indirectly, with or without relays, for the will of 
all to form the fundamental authority of sovereignty, the disciplines 
provide, at the base, a guarantee of the submission of forces and 
bodies. The real, corporal disciplines constituted the foundation of 
the formal, juridical liberties. The contract may have been regarded 
as the ideal foundation of law and political power; panopticism 
constituted the technique, universally widespread, of coercion. 
It continued to work in depth on the juridical structures of society, 
in order to make the effective mechanisms of power function in 
opposition to the formal framework that it had acquired. The 
'Enlightenment', which discovered the liberties, also invented the 
disciplines. 

In appearance, the disciplines constitute nothing more than an 
infra-law. They seem to extend the general forms defined by law to 
the infinitesimal level of individual lives; or they appear as methods 
of training that enable individuals to become integrated into these 
general demands. They seem to constitute the same type of law on 
a different scale, thereby making it more meticulous and more 
indulgent. The disciplines should be regarded as a sort of counter- 
law. They have the precise role of introducing insuperable asym¬ 
metries and excluding reciprocities. First, because discipline creates 
between individuals a ‘private’ link, which is a relation of constraints 
entirely different from contractual obligation; the acceptance of a 
discipline may be underwritten by contract; the way in which it is 
imposed, the mechanisms it brings into play, the non-reversible 


212 


Panopticism 


ubordination of one group of people by another, the ‘surplus’ 
power that is always fixed on the same side, the inequality of posi¬ 
tion of the different ‘partners' in relation to the common regulation, 
ill these distinguish the disciplinary link from the contractual link, 
«nd make it possible to distort the contractual link systematically 
from the moment it has as its content a mechanism of discipline. 
We know, for example, how many real procedures undermine the 
Irgal fiction of the work contract: workshop discipline is not the 
Irast important. Moreover, whereas the juridical systems define 
juridical subjects according to universal norms, the disciplines 
characterize, classify, specialize; they distribute along a scale, 
around a norm, hierarchize individuals in relation to one another 
■nd, if necessary, disqualify and invalidate. In any case, in the space 
and during the time in which they exercise their control and bring 
into play the asymmetries of their power, they effect a suspension 
of the law that is never total, but is never annulled either. Regular 
and institutional as it may be, the discipline, in its mechanism, is a 
'counter-law'. And, although the universal juridicism of modem 
society seems to fix limits on the exercise of power, its universally 
widespread panopticism enables it to operate, on the underside of 
the law, a machinery that is both immense and minute, which sup¬ 
ports, reinforces, multiplies the asymmetry of power and under¬ 
mines the limits that arc traced around the law. The minute disci¬ 
plines, the panopticisms of every day may well be below the level 
of emergence of the great apparatuses and the great political 
struggles. But, in the genealogy of modern society, they have been, 
with the class domination that traverses it, the political counterpart 
of the juridical norms according to which power was redistributed. 
Hence, no doubt, the importance that has been given for so long 
to the small techniques of discipline, to those apparently insignificant 
tricks that it has invented, and even to those 'sciences’ that give it a 
respectable face; hence the fear of abandoning them if one cannot 
find any substitute; hence the affirmation that they are at the very 
foundation of society, and an element in its equilibrium, whereas 
they are a series of mechanisms for unbalancing power relations 
definitively and everywhere; hence the persistence in regarding them 
as the humble, but concrete form of every morality, whereas they 
are a set of physico-political techniques. 


Discipline 


To return to the problem of legal punishments, the prison with 
all the corrective technology at its disposal is to be resituated at the 
point where the codified power to punish turns into a disciplinary 
power to observe; at the point where the universal punishments of 
the law are applied selectively to certain individuals and always the 
same ones; at the point where the redefinition of the juridical subject 
by the penalty becomes a useful training of the criminal; at the point 
where the law is inverted and passes outside itself, and where the 
counter-law becomes the effective and institutionalized content of 
the juridical forms. What generalizes the power to punish, then, is 
not the universal consciousness of the law in each juridical subject; 
it is the regular extension, the infinitely minute web of panoptic 
techniques. 

3. Taken one by one, most of these techniques have a long 
history behind them. But what was new, in the eighteenth century, 
was that, by being combined and generalized, they attained a level 
at which the formation of knowledge and the increase of power 
regularly reinforce one another in a circular process. At this point, 
the disciplines crossed the •technological’ threshold. First the 
hospital, then the school, then, later, the workshop were not sim¬ 
ply •reordered’ by the disciplines; they became, thanks to them, 
apparatuses such that any mechanism of objectification cculd be 
used in them as an instrument of subjection, and any growth of 
power could give rise in them to possible branches of knowledge; 
it was this link, proper to the technological systems, that made 
possible within the disciplinary element the formation of clinical 
medicine, psychiatry, child psychology, educational psychology, 
the rationalization of labour. It is a double process, then: an episte¬ 
mological ‘thaw’ through a refinement of power relations; a 
multiplication of the effects of power through the formation 
and accumulation of new forms of know ledge. 

The extension of the disciplinary methods is inscribed in a broat 
historical process: the development at about the same time of many 
other technologies - agronomical, industrial, economic. But it must 
be recognized that, compared with the mining industries, the 
emerging chemical industries or methods of national accountancy, 
compared with the blast furnaces or the steam engine, panopticism 
has received little attention. It is regarded as not much more than a 


Panopticism 


bizarre little utopia, a perverse dream - rather as though Bentham 
had been the Fourier of a police society, and the Phalanstery had 
taken on the form of the Panopticon. And yet this represented the 
abstract formula of a very real technology, that of individuals. 
There were many reasons why it received little praise; the most 
obvious is that the discourses to which it gave rise rarely acquired, 
except in the academic classifications, the status of sciences; but the 
real reason is no doubt that the power that it operates and which it 
augments is a direct, physical power that men exercise upon one 
another. An inglorious culmination had an origin that could be 
only grudgingly acknowledged. But it would be unjust to compare 
the disciplinary techniques with such inventions as the steam engine 
or Amici’s microscope. They are much less; and yet, in a way, they 
are much more. If a historical equivalent or at least a point of 
comparison had to be found for them, it would be rather in the 
'inquisitorial’ technique. 

The eighteenth century invented the techniques of discipline and 
the examination, rather as the Middle Ages invented the judicial 
investigation. But it did so by quite different means. The investiga¬ 
tion procedure, an old fiscal and administrative technique, had 
developed above all with the reorganization of the Church and the 
increase of the princely states in the twelfth and thirteenth cen¬ 
turies. At this time it permeated to a very large degree the juris¬ 
prudence first of the ecclesiastical courts, then of the lay courts. 
The investigation as an authoritarian search for a truth observed 
or attested was thus opposed to the old procedures of the oath, 
the ordeal, the judicial duel, the judgement of God or even of the 
transaction between private individuals. The investigation was the 
sovereign power arrogating to itself the right to establish the truth 
by a number of regulated techniques. Now, although the investiga¬ 
tion has since then been an integral part of western justice (even up 
to our own day), one must not forget either its political origin, its 
link with the birth of the states and of monarchical sovereignty, or 
its later extension and its role in the formation of knowledge. In 
fact, the investigation has been the no doubt crude, but fundamental 
element in the constitution of the empirical sciences; it has been the 
juridico-political matrix of this experimental knowledge, which, as 
we know*, was very rapidly released at the end of the Middle Ages. 








Discipline 




It is perhaps true to say that, in Greece, mathematics were bom 
from techniques of measurement; the sciences of nature, in any case, 
were born, to some extent, at the end of the Middle Ages, from the 
practices of investigation. The great empirical knowledge that 
covered the things of the world and transcribed them into the 
ordering of an indefinite discourse that observes, describes and 
establishes the ‘facts’ (at a time when the western world was begin¬ 
ning the economic and political conquest of this same world) had 
its operating model no doubt in the Inquisition - that immense 
invention that our recent mildness has placed in the dark recesses 
of our memory. But what this politico-juridical, administrative and 
criminal, religious and lay, investigation was to the sciences of 
nature, disciplinary analysis has been to the sciences of man. These 
sciences, which have so delighted our ’humanity’ for over a century, 
have their technical matrix in the petty, malicious minutiae of the 
disciplines and their investigations. These investigations are perhaps 
to psychology, psychiatry, pedagogy, criminology, and so many 
other strange sciences, what the terrible power of investigation was 
to the calm knowledge of the animals, the plants or the earth. 
Another power, another knowledge. On the threshold of the classi¬ 
cal age, Bacon, lawyer and statesman, tried to develop a methodology 
of investigation for the empirical sciences. What Great Observer 
will produce the methodology of examination for the human 
sciences? Unless, of course, such a thing is not possible. For, 
although it is true that, in becoming a technique for the empirical 
sciences, the investigation has detached itself from the inquisitorial 
procedure, in which it was historically rooted, the examination has 
remained extremely close to the disciplinary power that shaped it. 
It has always been and still is an intrinsic clement of the disciplines. 
Of course it seems to have undergone a speculative purification by 
integrating itself with such sciences as psychology and psychiatry. 
And, in effect, its appearance in the form of tests, interviews, 
interrogations and consultations is apparently in order to rectify 
the mechanisms of discipline: educational psychology is supposed to 
correct the rigours of the school, just as the medical or psychiatric 
interview' is supposed to rectify the effects of the discipline of work. 
But we must not be misled; these techniques merely refer individuals 
from one disciplinary authority to another, and they reproduce, in 


Panopticism 

« mcentrated or formalized form, the schema of pow’er-knowledge 
(•toper to each discipline (on this subject, cf. Tort). The great 
, Investigation that gave rise to the sciences of nature has become 
detached from its politico-juridical model; the examination, on the 
oilier hand, is still caught up in disciplinary technology. 

In the Middle Ages, the procedure of investigation gradually 
luperseded the old accusatory justice, by a process initiated from 
dhove; the disciplinary technique, on the other hand, insidiously 
and as if from below, has invaded a penal justice that is still, in 
principle, inquisitorial. All the great movements of extension that 
characterize modern penality - the problematization of the criminal 
l>ehind his crime, the concern with a punishment that is a correction, 
a therapy, a normalization, the division of the act of judgement 
l>etwecn various authorities that are supposed to measure, assess, 
diagnose, cure, transform individuals - all this betrays the penetra¬ 
tion of the disciplinary examination into the judicial inquisition. 

What is now imposed on penal justice as its point of application, 
its ‘useful’ object, will no longer be the body of the guilty man set 
up against the body of the king; nor will it be the juridical subject 
of an ideal contract; it will be the disciplinary individual. The 
extreme point of penal justice under the Ancien Regime was the 
infinite segmentation of the body of the regicide: a manifestation 
of the strongest power over the body of the greatest criminal, 
whose total destruction made the crime explode into its truth. The 
ideal point of penality today would be an indefinite discipline: an 
interrogation without end, an investigation that would be extended 
without limit to a meticulous and ever more analytical observation, 
a judgement that would at the same time be the constitution of a file 
that was never closed, the calculated leniency of a penalty that would 
be interlaced with the ruthless curiosity of an examination, a proce¬ 
dure that would be at the same time the permanent measure of a 
gap in relation to an inaccessible norm and the asymptotic move¬ 
ment that strives to meet in infinity. The public execution was the 
logical culmination of a procedure governed by the Inquisition. The 
practice of placing individuals under 'observation' is a natural exten¬ 
sion of a justice imbued with disciplinary methods and examination 
procedures. Is it surprising that the cellular prison, with its regular 
chronologies, forced labour, its authorities of surveillance and

PART FOUR 

Prison 




i. Complete and austere institutions 


I( would noi be true to say that the prison was born with the new 
codes. The prison form antedates its systematic use in the penal 
system. It had already been constituted outside the legal apparatus 
when, throughout the social body, procedures were being elaborated 
for distributing individuals, fixing them in space, classifying them, 
extracting from them the maximum in time and forces, training their 
bodies, coding their continuous behaviour, maintaining them in 
perfect visibility, forming around them an apparatus of observation, 
registration and recording, constituting on them a body of know¬ 
ledge that is accumulated and centralized. The general form of an 
apparatus intended to render individuals docile and useful, by means 
of precise work upon their bodies, indicated the prison institution, 
before the law ever defined it as the penalty par excellence. At the 
turn of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, there was, it is true, 
a penality of detention; and it was a new thing. But it was really the 
opening up of penality to mechanisms of coercion already elaborated 
elsewhere. The 'models’ of penal detention - Ghent, Gloucester, 
Walnut Street - marked the first visible points of this transition, 
rather than innovations or points of departure. The prison, an 
essential element in the punitive panopoly, certainly marks an import¬ 
ant moment in the history of penal justice: its access to 'humanity'. 
But it is also an important moment in the history of those disci¬ 
plinary mechanisms that the new class power was developing: that 
in which they colonized the legal institution. At the turn of the 
century, a new legislation defined the power to punish as a general 
function of society that was exercised in the same manner over all its 
members, and in which each individual was equally represented: but 
in making detention the penalty par excellence , it introduced proce¬ 
dures of domination characteristic of a particular type of power. A 


Prison 


justice that is supposed to be ‘equal’, a legal machinery that is 
supposed to be ‘autonomous’, but which contains all the asymmetries 
of disciplinary subjection, this conjunction marked the birth of the 
prison, 'the penalty of civilized societies’ (Rossi, 169). 

One can understand the self-evident character that prison punish¬ 
ment very soon assumed. In the first years of the nineteenth century, 
people were still aware of its novelty; and yet it appeared so bound 
up and at such a deep level with the very functioning of soci¬ 
ety that it banished into oblivion all the other punishments that 
the eighteenth-century reformers had imagined. It seemed to have 
no alternative, as if carried along by the very movement of history: 
‘It is not chance, it is not the whim of the legislator that have made 
imprisonment the base and almost the entire edifice of our present 
penal scale: it is the progress of ideas and the improvement in 
morals’ (Van Meenan, 529-30). And, although, in a little over a 
century, this self-evident character has become transformed, it has 
not disappeared. We are aware of all the inconveniences of prison, 
and that it is dangerous when it is not useless. And yet one cannot 
‘see’ how to replace it. It is the detestable solution, which one seems 
unable to do without. 

This ‘self-evident’ character of the prison, which we find so diffi¬ 
cult to abandon, is based first of all on the simple form of ‘depriva¬ 
tion of liberty’. How could prison not be the penalty par excellence 
in a society in which liberty is a good that belongs to all in the same 
way and to which each individual is attached, as Duport put it, by 
a 'universal and constant' feeling? Its loss has therefore the same 
value for all; unlike the fine, it is an ‘egalitarian’ punishment. The 
prison is the clearest, simplest, most equitable of penalties. More¬ 
over, it makes it possible to quantify the penalty exactly according 
to the variable of time. There is a wages-form of imprisonment that 
constitutes, in industrial societies, its economic ‘self-evidence’ - and 
enables it to appear as a reparation. By levying on the time of the 
prisoner, the prison seems to express in concrete terms the idea that 
the offence has injured, beyond the victim, society as a whole. There 
is an economico-moral self-evidence of a penality that metes out 
punishments in days, months and years and draws up quantitative 
equivalences between offences and durations. Hence the express¬ 
ion, so frequently heard, so consistent with the functioning of

punishments, though contrary to the strict theory of penal law, 
that one is in prison in order to ‘pay one's debt’. The prison is 
‘natural’, just as the use of time to measure exchanges is ‘natural’ 
in our society. 1 

But the self-evidence of the prison is also based on its role, 
supposed or demanded, as an apparatus for transforming individuals. 
How could the prison not be immediately accepted when, by locking 
up, retraining and rendering docile, it merely reproduces, with a 
little more emphasis, all the mechanisms that are to be found in the 
social body? The prison is like a rather disciplined barracks, a strict 
school, a dark workshop, but not qualitatively different. This double 
foundation - juridico-economic on the one hand, technico-disciplin- 
ary on the other - made the prison seem the most immediate and 
civilized form of all penalties. And it is this double functioning that 
immediately gave it its solidity. One thing is clear: the prison was 
not at first a deprivation of liberty to which a technical function of 
correction was later added; it was from the outset a form of 'legal 
detention’ entrusted with an additional corrective task, or an enter¬ 
prise for reforming individuals that the deprivation of liberty 
allowed to function in the legal system. In short, penal imprison¬ 
ment, from the beginning of the nineteenth century, covered both 
the deprivation of liberty and the technical transformation of 
individuals. 

Let us remember a number of facts. In the codes of 1808 and 1810, 
and the measures that immediately preceded or followed them, 
imprisonment was never confused with mere deprivation of liberty. 
It was, or in any case had to be, a differentiated and finalized mechan¬ 
ism. Differentiated because it had to have the same form, whether 
the prisoner had been sentenced or was merely accused, whether he 
was a minor offender or a criminal: the various types of prison - 
maison d’arrit , maison de correction , maison centrale - ought in 
principle to correspond more or less to these differences and provide 
a punishment that would be not only graduated in intensity, but 
diversified in its ends. For the prison has a purpose, which is laid 
down at the outset: ‘The law inflicting penalties, some of which are 
more serious than others, cannot allow the individual condemned 
to light penalties to be imprisoned in the same place as the criminal 
condemned to more serious penalties ... although the penalty fixed 


2 33 




Prison 


by the law has as its principal aim the reparation of the crime, it also 
desires the amendment of the guilty man’ (Real, 244). And this 
transformation must be one of the internal effects of imprisonment. 
Prison-punishment, prison-apparatus: "The order that must reign in 
the maison de force may contribute pow-erfully to the regeneration 
of the convicts; the vices of upbringing, the contagion of bad 
example, idleness ... have given birth to crime. Well, let us try to 
close up all these sources of corruption; let the rules of a healthy 
morality be practised in the maisons de force ; that, compelled to work, 
convicts may come in the end to like it; when they have reaped the 
reward, they will acquire the habit, the taste, the need for occupa¬ 
tion; let them give each other the example of a laborious life; it will 
soon become a pure life; soon they will begin to know regret for the 
past, the first harbinger of a love of duty.’ 2 The techniques of cor¬ 
rection immediately form part of the institutional framework ol 
penal detention. 

One should also recall that the movement for reforming the pri¬ 
sons, for controlling their functioning is not a recent phenomenon. 
It does not even seem to have originated in a recognition of failure. 
Prison ‘reform’ is virtually contemporary with the prison itself: it 
constitutes, as it were, its programme. From the outset, the prison 
was caught up in a scries of accompanying mechanisms, whose 
purpose was apparently to correct it, but which seem to form part 
of its very functioning, so closely have they been bound up with its 
existence throughout its long history. There was, at once, a prolix 
technology of the prison. There were inquiries: that of Chaptal in 
1801 (whose task it W3S to discover what could be used to introduce 
the modern prison system into France), that of Decazcs in 1819, 
Villermc’s work published in 1820, the report on the maisons cen¬ 
trales drawn up by Marti gnac in 1829, the inquiries carried out in 
the United States by Beaumont and Tocqucville in 1831, by Demetz 
and Blouet in 1833, the questionnaires addressed by Montalivet to 
the directors of the maisons centrales and to the general councils of 
the dipartements during the debate on solitary confinement. There 
were societies for supervising the functioning of the prisons and for 
suggesting improvements: in 1818, the very official Soctiti pour 
1 ’amelioration des prisons , a little later the SocUU des prisons and 
various philanthropic groups. Innumerable measures - orders,

instructions or laws: from the reform that the first Restoration had 
rnvisaged in September 1814, and which was never implemented, to 
the law of 1844, drawn up by Tocquevillc, which ended for a time 
the long debate on the means of making imprisonment effective. 
l*here were programmes drawn up to improve the functioning of 
the machine-prison:* programmes for the treatment of the prisoners, 
models for material improvement, some of these, like those of 
Danjou and Harou-Romain, remaining no more than projects, 
others becoming embodied in instructions (like the circular of 9 
August 1841 on the building of maisons d'arrit) y others becoming 
actual buildings, such as the Petite Roquette in which cellular 
imprisonment was organized for the first time in France. 

To these should be added the publications that sprang more or 
less directly from the prison and were drawn up either by philan¬ 
thropists like Appert, or a little later by ‘specialists’ (such as the 
Annales de la Chariti)* or, again, by former prisoners; Pauvre 
Jacques at the end of the Restoration, or the Gazette de Sainte- 
Pilagie at the beginning of the July monarchy. 8 

The prison should not be seen as an inert institution, shaken at 
intervals by reform movements. The ‘theory of the prison’ was its 
constant set of operational instructions rather than its incidental 
criticism - one of its conditions of functioning. The prison has 
always formed part of an active field in which projects, improve¬ 
ments, experiments, theoretical statements, personal evidence and 
investigations have proliferated. The prison institution has always 
been a focus of concern and debate. Is the prison still, then, a dark, 
abandoned region? Is the fact that one has ceased to say so for 
almost 200 years sufficient proof that it is not? In becoming a legal 
punishment, it weighted the old juridico-political question of the 
right to punish with all the problems, all the agitations that have 
surrounded the corrective technologies of the individual. 

Baltard called them ‘complete and austere institutions’ (Baltard, 
1829). In several respects, the prison must be an exhaustive disciplin¬ 
ary apparatus: it must assume responsibility for all aspects of the 
individual, his physical training, his aptitude to work, his everyday 
conduct, his moral attitude, his state of mind; the prison, much more 
than the school, the workshop or the army, which always involved a 


*35 






Prison 


certain specialization, is ‘omni-disciplinary’. Moreover, the prison 
has neither exterior nor gap; it cannot be interrupted, except when 
its task is totally completed; its action on the individual must be 
uninterrupted: an unceasing discipline. Lastly, it gives almost total 
power over the prisoners; it has its internal mechanisms of repression 
and punishment: a despotic discipline. It carries to their grea 
intensity all the procedures to be found in the other disciplin; 
mechanisms. It must be the most powerful machinery for imposi 
a new form on the perverted individual; its mode of action is the 
constraint of a total education: 'In prison the government may 
dispose of the liberty of the person and of the time of the prisoner, 
from then on, one can imagine the power of the education which, 
not only in a day, but in the succession of days and even years, may 
regulate for man the time of waking and sleeping, of activity and rest, 
the number and duration of meals, the quality and ration of food, 
the nature and product of labour, the time of prayer, the use ol 
speech and even, so to speak, that of thought, that education which, 
in the short, simple journeys from refectory to workshop, from 
workshop to the cell, regulates the movements of the body, and even 
in moments of rest, determines the use of time, the time-table, this 
education, which, in short, takes possession of man as a whole, of 
all the physical and moral faculties that arc in him and of the time 
in which he is himself* (Lucas, II, 123-4). This complete 'reforma¬ 
tory' lays down a recoding of existence very different from the mere 
juridical deprivation of liberty and very different, too, from the 
simple mechanism of cxcmpla imagined by the reformers at the time 
of the ideologues. 

1. The first principle was isolation. The isolation of the convict 
from the external world, from everything that motivated the offence, 
from the complicities that facilitated it. The isolation of the prisoners 
from one another. Not only must the penalty be individual, but it 
must also be individualizing - in two ways. First, the prison must be 
designed in such a way as to efface of itself the harmful consequences 
to which it gives rise in gathering together very different convicts 
in the same place: to stifle plots and revolts, to prevent the formation 
of future complicities that may give rise to blackmail (when the 
convicts are once again at liberty), to form an obstacle to the im¬ 
morality of so many ‘mysterious associations’. In short, the prison 


236 


Complete and austere institutions 


iliould form from the malefactors that it gathers together a homo¬ 
geneous and interdependent population: ‘There exists at this moment 
among us an organized society of criminals ... They form a small 
nation within the greater. Almost all these men met or meet again 
in prison. We must now disperse the members of this society' 
(Tocqueville, Rapport a la Chambre des Diputis , quoted in Beau¬ 
mont and Tocqueville, 392-3). Moreover, through the reflection 
that it gives rise to and the remorse that cannot fail to follow, 
solitude must be a positive instrument of reform: 'Thrown into 
solitude, the convict reflects. Placed alone in the presence of his 
crime, he learns to hate it, and, if his soul is not yet blunted by evil, 
it is in isolation that remorse will come to assail him' (Beaumont and 
Tocqueville, 109). Through the fact, too, that solitude assures a 
sort of self-regulation of the penalty and makes possible a spontane¬ 
ous individualization of the punishment: the more the convict is 
capable of reflecting, the more capable he was of committing his 
crime; but, also, the more lively his remorse, the more painful his 
solitude; on the other hand, when he has profoundly repented and 
made amends without the least dissimulation, solitude will no longer 
weigh upon him: ‘Thus, according to this admirable discipline, each 
intelligence and each morality bears within itself the principle and 
measure of a punishment whose error and human fallibility cannot 
alter the certainty and invariable equity ... Is it not in truth like 
the seal of a divine and providential justice?’ (Aylies, 132-3). Lastly, 
and perhaps above all, the isolation of the convicts guarantees that 
it is possible to exercise over them, with maximum intensity, a 
power that will not be overthrown by any other influence; solitude 
is the primary' condition of total submission: ‘Just imagine,' said 
Charles Lucas, referring to the role of the governor, the instructor, 
the chaplain and other 'charitable persons’ as regards the isolated 
convict, 'just imagine the power of human speech intervening in 
the midst of the terrible discipline of silence to speak to the heart, 
to the soul, to the human person' (Lucas, I, 167). Isolation provides 
an intimate exchange between the convict and the power that is 
exercised over him. 

It is at this point that the debate on the two American systems of 
imprisonment, that of Auburn and that of Philadelphia, was situated. 
In fact, this debate, which was so wide-ranging and long drawn out, 8 


237 




Prison 


t 


concerned only the way in w hich isolation should be used, it bci 
accepted by all. 

The Auburn model prescribed the individual cell during • 
night, work and meals in common, but under the rule of absol 
silence, the convicts being allowed to speak only to the wardc 
with their permission and in a low voice. It was a clear reference 
the monastic model; a reference, too, to the discipline of the wor 
shop. The prison must be the microcosm of a perfect society 
which individuals arc isolated in their moral existence, but in whi 
they come together in a strict hierarchical framework, w:th i 
lateral relation, communication being possible only in a vertical, 
direction. The advantage of the Auburnian system, according to it* 
advocates, was that it formed a duplication of society itself. Con¬ 
straint was assured by material means, but above all by a rule that 
one had to learn to respect and which was guaranteed by surveillance 
and punishment. Rather than keep the convicts ‘under lock and key 
like wild beasts in their cages’, they must be brought together, 
‘made to join together in useful exercises, forced together to adopt 
good habits, preventing moral contagion by active surveillance, 
maintaining reflection by the rule of silence'; this rule accustoms the 
convict 'to regard the law as a sacred precept whose violation brings 
just and legitimate harm' (Mittermaicr, in Revue fran^aise et iirangett 
de legislation, 1836). Thus this operation of isolation, assembly 
without communication and law- guaranteed by uninterrupted 
supervision, must rehabilitate the criminal as a social individual: it 
trains him to a ‘useful and resigned activity' (Gasparin); it restores 
for him 'habits of sociability’ (Beaumont and Tocqucville, 1 12). 

In absolute isolation - as at Philadelphia - the rehabilitation of 
the criminal is expected not of the application of a common law', 
but of the relation of the individual to his own conscience and to 
what may enlighten him from within. 7 ‘Alone in his cell, the convict 
is handed over to himself; in the silence of his passions and of the 
world that surrounds him, he descends into his conscience, he 
questions it and feels awakening within him the moral feeling that 
never entirely perishes in the heart of man" (Journal des economistes , 
II, 1842). It is not, therefore, an external respect for the law- or fear 
of punishment alone that will act upon the convict but the workings 
of the conscience itself. A profound submission, rather than a super- 


Complete and austere institutions 


L In i d training; a change of‘morality’, rather than of attitude. In the 
I IVnnsylvanian prison, the only operations of correction were the 
*<nsciencc and the silent architecture that confronted it. At Cherry 
Hill, ‘the w-alls are the punishment of the crime; the cell confronts 
1 the convict with himself; he is forced to listen to his conscience’. 

) Hence work there is more in the nature of a consolation than an 
jligation; supervisors do not have to exert force - this is assured 
•y the materiality of things - and consequently, their authority may 
* accepted: ‘At each visit, a few benevolent words flow' from this 
•nest mouth and bring to the heart of the inmate gratitude, hope 
id consolation; he loves his warder; and he loves him because he 
| 11 gentle and sympathetic. Walls are terrible, but man is good’ 
Blouet). In this closed cell, this temporary sepulchre, the myths of 
resurrection arise easily enough. After night and silence, the regener- 
itrd life. Auburn w'as society itself reduced to its bare essentials. 
Cherry Hill was life annihilated and begun again. Catholicism soon 
tbsorbed this Quaker technique into its discourses. ‘I see your cell 
is no more than a frightful sepulchre where, instead of worms, 
remorse and despair come to gnaw at you and to turn your existence 
into a hell in anticipation. But.. . what is for an irreligious prisoner 
merely a tomb, a repulsive ossuary, becomes, for the sincerely 
Christian convict, the very cradle of blessed immortality.’ 8 

A whole series of different conflicts stemmed from the opposition 
between these two models: religious (must conversion be the princi¬ 
pal element of correction?), medical (docs total isolation drive 
convicts insane?), economic (which method costs less?), architec¬ 
tural and administrative (which form guarantees the best surveil¬ 
lance?). Tit is, no doubt, was why the argument lasted so long. But, 
at the heart of the debate, and making it possible, was this primary 
objective of carceral action: coercive individualization, by the 
termination of any relation that is not supervised by authority or 
arranged according to hierarchy. 

2. ‘Work alternating with meals accompanies the convict to 
evening prayer; then a new sleep gives him an agreeable rest that is 
not disturbed by the phantoms of an unregulated imagination. Thus 
the six weekdays pass by. They are followed by a day devoted 
exclusively to prayer, instruction and salutary meditations. Thus 
the w'eeks, the months, the years follow one another; thus the

prisoner who, on entering the establishment, was an in:on 
man, or one who was single-minded only in his irregularity, seeki 
to destroy his existence by the variety of his vices, gradually bee 
by dint of a habit that is at first purely external, but is soon ti.> 
formed into a second nature, so familiar with w’ork and the pleasi 
that derive from it, that, provided wise instruction has opened 
his soul to repentance, he may be exposed with more confidence 
temptations, when he finally recovers his liberty' (Julius, 417-1 
Work is defined, with isolation, as an agent of carceral transfo 
tion. This is to be found as early as the code of 1808: ‘Although tin 
penalty inflicted by the law has as its aim the reparation of a cri 
it is also intended to reform the convict, and this double aim w 
be fulfilled if the malefactor is snatched from that fatal idlenr 
which, having brought him to prison, meets him again within 
walls and, seizing hold of him, brings him to the ultimate degree 
depravity.’ 9 Work is neither an addition nor a corrective to t 
regime of detention: whether it is a question of forced laboi 
reclusion or imprisonment, it is conceived, by the legislator him* 
as necessarily accompanying it. But the necessity involved is p 
ciscly not the necessity of which the eighteenth-century reform 
spoke, when they wished to make imprisonment cither an exam 
for the public or a useful reparation for society. In the caret, 
regime, the link between work and punishment is of another type. 

Several polemics that took place under the Restoration and the 
July Monarchy throw light on the function attributed to penal 
labour. First, there was the debate on the subject of wages. The 
labour of prisoners was remunerated in France. This posec a prob¬ 
lem: if work in prison is remunerated, that work cannot really form 
part of die penalty; and the prisoner may therefore refuse to perform 
it. Moreover, wages reward the skill of the worker and not the 
improvement of the convict: The worst subjects arc almost every¬ 
where the most skilful workers; they are the most highly remuner¬ 
ated, consequently the most intemperate and least ready to repent’ 
(Marquet-Wasselot, quoted in Lucas, 324). The debate, which had 
never quite died down, was resumed with great liveliness in the 
early 1840s: it was a period of economic crisis, a period of workers' 
agitation and a period, too, in which the opposition between the 
worker and the delinquent was beginning to crystallize (cf. below, 


240

IM). There were strikes against the prison workshops: w'hcn a 
t luumont glove-maker succeeded in organizing a workshop at 
( l.nrvaux, the workers protested, declared that their labour was 
(• honoured, occupied the manufactory and forced the employer to 
• mdon his project (cf. Aguet, 30-31). There was also a widespread 
.s campaign in the workers’ newspapers: on the theme that the 
ovemment encouraged penal labour in order to reduce ‘free’ wages; 

11 the theme that the inconveniences of these prison workshops 
»ere even more evident for women, who were thus deprived of their 
Ijbour, driven to prostitution and therefore to prison, where these 
ume women, who could no longer work when they were free, then 
. ompeted with those who were still at work ( 1 'Atelier , 3rd year, 
no. 4, December 1842); on the theme that prisoners were given the 
•.jfest jobs - ‘in warm and sheltered conditions thieves execute the 
work of hat-making and cabinet-making’, while the unemployed 
hatter is forced to go ‘to the human slaughter-house to make white- 
lead at two francs a day’ {VAtelier, 6th year, no. 2, November 1845); 
on the theme that philanthropy is more concerned about the work¬ 
ing conditions of prisoners than those of free workers: ’We arc sure 
that if prisoners worked with mercury, for example, science would 
be a great deal more ready than it is to find ways of protecting the 
workers from the dangers of its fumes: "Those poor convicts?" 
someone would exclaim, who scarcely has a word for the gilders. 
But what can you expect? One has to have killed or robbed to 
.irousc compassion or interest.’ On the theme above all that, if the 
prison was tending to become a workshop, it would not be long 
before beggars and the unemployed were sent there, thus reconsti¬ 
tuting the old hSpitaux gtntraux of France or the workhouses of 
England. In addition, there were petitions and letters, especially 
after the law of 1844 - one petition, rejected by the Chambre dc 
Paris, ‘found inhuman that one should propose to apply murderers 
and thieves to work that is today the lot of a few thousand workers’; 
’the Chambre preferred Barrabas to us’ (L’Atelier, 4th year, no. 9, 
June 1844 and 3th year, no. 7, April 1845; cf. also, of the same 
period, La Democratic pacifiquc)-, typographical workers sent a 
letter to the minister when they learnt that a printing-works was to 
be set up in the prison at Melun: ‘You have decided between 
reprobates justly punished by' the law and citizens who sacrifice 


Prison 


their days, in abstinence and probity, to the lives of their families and 
to the wealth of their nation' (VAtelier, 5 th year, no. 6, March 184*). 

The answers given by the government and the administration t<* 
this whole campaign changed very little. Penal labour cannot hr 
criticized for any unemployment it may give rise to: with its limited 
extent, and its low output, it cannot have a general effect on the I 
economy. It is intrinsically useful, not as an activity of production, * 
but by virtue of the effect it has on the human mechanism. It is 4 I 
principle of order and regularity; through the demands that il 
imposes, it conveys, imperceptibly, the forms of a rigorous power; 
it bends bodies to regular movements, it excludes agitation and 
distraction, it imposes a hierarchy and a surveillance that are all the 
more accepted, and which will be inscribed all the more deeply in 
the behaviour of the convicts, in that they form part of its logic? 3. 
with work 'the rule is introduced into a prison, it reigns there with* 
out effort, without the use of any repressive and violent means. 

By occupying the convict, one gives him habits of order and obedi¬ 
ence; one makes the idler that he was diligent and active ... with 
time, he finds in the regular movement of the prison, in the manual 
labours to which he is subjected ... a certain remedy against the 
wanderings of his imagination’ (Berenger). Penal labour must be 
seen as the very machinery that transforms the violent, agitated, 
unreflective convict into a part that plays its role with perfect 
regularity. The prison is not a workshop; it is, it must be of itself, 
a machine whose convict-workers are both the cogs and the pro¬ 
ducts; it 'occupies them continually, with the sole aim of filling their 
moments. When the body is agitated, when the mind applies itself 
to a particular object, importunate ideas depart, calm is bom once 
again in the soul’ (Danjou, 180). If, in the final analysis, the work of 
the prison has an economic effect, it is by producing individuals 
mechanized according to the general norms of an industrial society: 
'Work is the providence of the modern peoples; it replaces morality, 
fills the gap left by beliefs and is regarded as the principle of all good. 
Work must be the religion of the prisons. For a machine-society, 
purely mechanical means of reform are required' (Faucher, 64; in 
England the 'treadmill' and the pump provided a disciplinary 
mechanization of the inmates, with no end product). The making 
of machine-men, but also of proletarians; in effect, when one has 


24Z

only a ‘pair of arms for any good work', one can live only ‘from 
1 he product of one’s labour, through the practice of a profession or 
f rom the product of the labour of others, by thieving'; but, although 
the prison did not force offenders to work, it seems to have reintro¬ 
duced into its very institution and, obliquely, by means of taxation, 
this levying by some on the labour of others: ‘ The question of 
idleness is the same as in society; it is from the labour of others that 
the convicts live, if they do not exist from their own labour’ (Lucas, 
II, 313-14). The labour by which the convict contributes to his 
own needs turns the thief into a docile worker. This is the utility 
of remuneration for penal labour; it imposes on the convict the 
'moral' form of wages as the condition of his existence. Wages 
inculcate the 'love and habit' of work (Lucas, II, 243); they give 
those malefactors who do not know the difference between mine 
and thine a sense of property - of'what one has earned by the sweat 
of one's brow' (Danjou, 210-11; cf. also L'Atelier, 6th year, no. 2, 
November 1845); they also teach those who have lived in dissipa¬ 
tion the virtues of thrift and foresight (Lucas; a third of the prisoner's 
daily wages w-as set aside for the day when he left the prison); lastly, 
by proposing a quantity of work to be carried out, they make it 
possible to express quantitatively the convict’s zeal and the progress 
of his improvement (Ducpitiaux, 30-31). The wages of penal labour 
do not reward production; they function as a motive and measure 
of individual transformation: it is a legal fiction, since it docs not 
represent the 'free' granting of labour power, but an artifice that 
is presumed to be effective in the techniques of correction. 

What, then, is the use of penal labour? Not profit; nor even the 
formation of a useful skill; but the constitution of a pow’er relation, 
an empty economic form, a schema of individual submission and of 
adjustment to a production apparatus. 

The perfect image of prison labour w^as the women's workshop 
at Clairvaux; the silent precision of the human machinery is reminis¬ 
cent of the regulated rigour of the convent: ‘On a throne, above 
which is a crucifix, a sister is sitting; before her, arranged in two 
rows, the prisoners arc carrying out the task imposed on them, and, 
as needlework accounts for almost all the work, the strictest silence 
is constantly maintained. . . It seems that, in these halls, the very 
air breathes penitence and expiation. One is carried back, as by a 


243 




Prison 




spontaneous movement, to the time of the venerable habits of 
ancient place, one remembers those voluntary penitents who 
themselves up here in order to say farewell to the world’. Com 
this with the following; ‘Go into a cotton-mill; listen to the 
versations of the workers and the whistling of the machines. Is 
any contrast in the world more afflicting than the regularity 
predictability of these mechanical movements, compared with 
disorder of ideas and morals, produced by the contact of so 
men, women and children' (Faucher 20). 

3. But prison goes beyond the mere privation of liberty 
more important way. It becomes increasingly an instrument for 
modulation of the penalty; an apparatus which, through the 
tion of the sentence with which it is entrusted, seems to have 
right, in part at least, to assume its principle. Of course, the 
institution was not given this ‘right’ in the nineteenth century 
even in the twentieth, except in a fragmentary form (through 1 
oblique way of release on licence, semi-release, the organization 
reformatories). But it should be noted that it was claimed 
early on by those responsible for prison administration, as the 
condition of the good functioning of a prison, and of its effici 
in the task of reformation that the law itself had given it. 

The same goes for the duration of the punishment; it makes 11 
possible to quantify the penalties exactly, to graduate them accord 
ing to circumstances and to give to legal punishment the more or 
explicit form of wages; but it also runs the risk of having no co 
tivc value, if it is fixed once and for all in the sentence. The length 
of the penalty must not be a measurement of the 'exchange value' 
of the offence; it must be adjusted to the ‘useful’ transformation ol 
the inmate during his term of imprisonment. It is not a time- 
measure, but a time finalized. The form of the operation, rathet 
than the form of the wages. 'Just as the prudent physician ends his 
medication or continues it according to whether the patient has 
or has not arrived at a perfect cure, so, in the first of these two 
hypotheses, expiation ought to end with the complete reform of the 
prisoner; for, in this case, all detention has become useless, and from 
then on as inhuman to the reformed individual as it is vainly burden¬ 
some for the State.' 10 The correct duration of the penalty must be 
calculated, therefore, not only according to the particular crime and 




244

£ 


tu circumstances, but also according to the penalty itself as it takes 
I'Mce in actual fact. This amounts to saying that, although the 
j«-n3lty must be individualized, it is so not on the basis of the 
individual-offender, the juridical subject of his act, the responsible 
thor of the offence, but on the basis of the individual punished, 
e object of a supervised transformation, the individual in detention 
serted in the prison apparatus, modified by it or reacting to it. 'It 
question only of reforming the evil-doer. Once this reform has 
te about, the criminal must return to society' (C. Lucas, quoted 
the Gaiette des iribunaux, 6 April 1837). 

The quality and content of detention should no longer be deter¬ 
mined by the nature of the offence alone. The juridical gravity of a 
.rime does not at all have die value of a univocal sign for the 
character of the convict, whether or not he is capable of reform. In 
particular the crime-offence distinction, which the penal code 
recognized in drawing the corresponding distinction between mere 
imprisonment and imprisonment with hard labour,, is not opera¬ 
tional in terms of reform. This was the almost universal opinion 
expressed by the directors of the maisons centrales y during an inquiry 
carried out by the ministry in 1836: 'The minor offenders are gener¬ 
ally the most vicious. . . Among the criminals, one meets many 
men who have given in to the violence of their passions and to the 
needs of a large family.' ‘The behaviour of criminals is much better 
than that of the minor offenders; the former arc more submissive, 
harder-working than the latter, w-ho, in general, are pickpockets, 
debauchees and idlers.’ 11 Hence the idea that punitive rigour must 
not be in direct proportion to the penal importance of the offence - 
nor determined once and for all. 

As an operation of correction, imprisonment has its own require¬ 
ments and dangers. It is its effects that must determine its stages, its 
temporary increases, its successive reductions, in severity; what 
Charles Lucas called the ‘mobile classification of moralities’. The 
progressive system applied at Geneva since 1825 was often advo¬ 
cated in France (Fresnel, 29-31). It took the form, for example, of 
three areas: a trial area for prisoners in general, a punishment area 
and a reward area for those w-ho had embarked on the w'ay of reform 
(Lucas, II, 440). Or it took the form of four phases: a period of 
intimidation (deprivation of work and of any internal or external 





Prison 


relations); a period of work (isolation, but work which, after tl*r 
phase of forced idleness, would be welcomed as a benefit); a r£gln» 
of moralization (more or less frequent ‘lectures’ from the directofll 
and official visitors); a period of work in common (Duras). Although u 
the principle of the penalty was certainly a legal decision, ii» 
administration, its quality and its rigours must belong to an autono*! 
mous mechanism that supervises the effects of punishment wirhin tlmf 
very apparatus that produces them. A whole regime of punishment* 
and rewards that is a way not simply of gaining respect for the prison! 
regulations, but of making the action of the prison on the inmatr* 
effective. The legal authority itself came to accept this: 'One should 
not be surprised, said the supreme court of appeal, when consulted 
on the subject of a bill concerning the prisons, at the idea of granting 
rewards, which might consist either for the most part in money, or 
in a better diet, or even in a reduction of the duration of the penalty. 

II anything can awaken in the minds of convicts the notions of good 
and evil, bring them to moral reflections and raise them to some 
extent in their own eyes, it is the possibility of obtaining some 
reward’ (Lucas, II, 441-2). 

And it must be admitted that the legal authorities can have no * 
immediate control over all these procedures that rectify the penalty 
as it proceeds. It is a question, in effect, of measures that by 
definition can intervene only after the sentence and can bear only on 
something other than the offences. Those who administer detention 
must therefore have an indispensable autonomy, when it comes to 
the question of individualizing and varying the application of the 
penalty: supervisors, a prison governor, a chaplain or an instructor 
are more capable of exercising this corrective function than those 
who hold the penal power. It is their judgement (understood as 
observation, diagnosis, characterization, information, differential 
classification) and not a verdict in the form of an attribution of guilt, 
that must serve as a support for this internal modulation of the 
penalty - for its mitigation or even its interruption. When in 1846, 
Bonneville presented his projecr of release on licence, he defined it 
as 'the right of the administration, with the previous approval of the 
legal authority, to place in temporary liberty, after a sufficient period 
of expiation, the completely reformed convict, on condition that he 
will be brought back into prison on the slightest well-founded 


Complete and austere institutions 


• omplaint’ (Bonneville, 5). All this ‘arbitrariness’ which, in the 
•Id penal system, enabled the judges to modulate the penalty 
and the princes to ignore it if they so wished, all this arbitrariness, 
which the modem codes have withdrawn from the judicial power, 
I us been gradually reconstituted on the side of the power that 
administers and supervises punishment. It is the sovereignty of 
knowledge possessed by the warden 'He is a veritable magistrate 

• ailed upon to reign as sovereign in the prison ... who, in order not 
to fall short in his mission, must combine the most eminent virtue 
with a profound knowledge of mankind' (Berenger). 

And so we arrive at a principle, clearly formulated by Charles 
Lucas, which, although ir marks the virtual beginning of modem 
penal functioning, very few jurists would dare to accept today 
without some hesitation; let us call it the Declaration of C-arceral 
Independence - in it is claimed the right to be a power that not only 
possesses administrative autonomy, but is also a part of punitive 

• overeignty. This affirmation of the rights of the prison posits as a 
principle: that criminal judgement is an arbitrary unity; that it must 
be broken dow-n; that the writers of the penal codes were correct in 
distinguishing the legislative level (which classifies the acts and attri¬ 
butes penalties to them) and the judicial level (which passes the 
sentences); that the task today is to analyse in turn this later judicial 
level; that one should distinguish in it what is properly judicial 
(assess not so much acts as agents, measure 'the intcntionalities that 
give human acts so many different moralities’, and therefore rectify 
if it can the assessments of the legislator); and to give autonomy to 
'penitentiary judgement', which is perhaps the most important; in 
relation to it the assessment of the court is merely a 'way of pre¬ 
judging’, for the morality of the agent can be assessed ‘only when 
put to the test. The judge, therefore, requires in turn a compulsory 
and rectifying supervision of his assessments; and this supervision 
is that provided by the penitentiary prison' (Lucas, II, 418-22). 

One may speak, therefore, of an excess or a series of excesses on 
the pan of imprisonment in terms of legal detention - of the ‘car- 
ceral’ in relation to the 'judicial'. Now this excess was observed very 
early on, from the very binh of the prison, either in the form of real 
practices, or in the form of projects. It did not come later, as a 
secondary effect. The great carceral machinery was bound up with 




Prison 


the very functioning of the prison. The sign of this autonomy 
very apparent in the ‘useless’ acts of violence perpetrated by w 
or in the despotism of an administration that has all the privileges 
an enclosed community. Its roots lie elsewhere: precisely in the 
that the prison is required to be 'useful', that the deprivation 
liberty - that juridical levying on an ideal property - must, ft 
the outset, have exercised a positive technical role, operating trans¬ 
formations on individuals. And, for this operation, the carceral 
apparatus has recourse to three great schemata: the politico- 
schema of individual isolation and hierarchy; the economic model 
of force applied to compulsory work; the technico-medica! model 
of cure and normalization. The cell, the workshop, the hospital. 
The margin by which the prison exceeds detention is filled in fact 
by techniques of a disciplinary type. And this disciplinary addition 
to the juridical is what, in short, is called the ‘penitentiary’. 


This addition was not accepted easily. To begin with, there was 
the question of principle: the penalty must be nothing more than 
the deprivation of liberty; like our present rulers, but with all thr 
freshness of his language, Decazes says: ‘The law must follow thr 
convicted man into the prison where it has sent him' (Decazes). But 
very soon - and this is a characteristic fact - these debates were to 
become a battle for appropriating control of this additional peni 
tentiary clement; the judges were to demand a right of inspection 
over the carceral mechanisms: 'The moral enlightenment of the 
inmates requires innumerable cooperators; it is only by visits of 
inspection, commissions of surveillance and charity associations that 
this may be accomplished. Auxiliaries, then, are needed and it is the 
judges who must provide them’ (Fcrrus, viii; an ordinance of 1847 
had set up commissions of surveillance). From this period, the 
penitentiary order had become sufficiently well established for there 
to be no question of dismantling it; the question was how to get 
control of it. This gave rise to the figure of the judge obsessed by a 
desire for prison. A century later, this was to give birth to a bastard, 
yet deformed child: the magistrate entrusted with the determination 
of penalties. 

But, if the penitentiary, in so far as it went well beyond mere 
detention, was able not only to establish itself, but to entrap the 


248 


Complete and austere institutions 


whole of penal justice and to imprison the judges themselves, it was 
t«cause it was able to introduce criminal justice into relations of 
knowledge that have since become its infinite labyrinth. 

The prison, the place where the penalty is carried out, is also the 
place of observation of punished individuals. This takes two forms: 
surveillance, of course, but also knowledge of each inmate, of his 
Ixrhaviour, his deeper states of mind, his gradual improvement; the 
prisons must be conceived as places for the formation of clinical 
knowledge about the convicts; 'the penitentiary system cannot be 
.in a priori conception; it is an induction of the social state. There are 
moral diseases, as well as breakdowns in health, where the treatment 
depends on the site and direction of the illness’ (Faucher, 6). This 
involves two essential mechanisms. It must be possible to hold the 
prisoner under permanent observation; every report that can be 
made about him must be recorded and computed. The theme of the 
Panopticon at once surveillance and observation, security and 
knowledge, individualization and totalization, isolation and trans¬ 
parency - found in the prison its privileged locus of realization. 
Although the panoptic procedures, as concrete forms of the exercise 
of power, have become extremely widespread, at least in their less 
concentrated forms, it was really only in the penitentiary institu¬ 
tions that Bcntham's utopia could be fully expressed in a material 
form. In the 1830s, the Panopticon became the architectural pro¬ 
gramme of most prison projects. It was the most direct way of 
expressing 'the intelligence of discipline in stone’ (Lucas, I, 69); of 
making architecture transparent to the administration of power ;' 2 
of making it possible to substitute for force or other violent con¬ 
straints the gentle efficiency of total surveillance; of ordering space 
according to the recent humanization of the codes and the new 
penitentiary theory: ‘The authorities, on the one hand, and the 
architect, on the other, must know, therefore, whether the prisons 
arc to be based on the principle of milder penalties or on a system 
of reforming convicts, in accordance with legislation which, by 
getting to the root cause of the people’s vices, becomes a principle 
that will regenerate the virtues that they must practice' (Baltard,4-f)- 

In short, its task was to constitute a prison-machine 13 with a cell 
of visibility in which the inmate will find himself caught as 'in the 
glass house of the Greek philosopher' (Harou-Romain, 8) and a 


249 



Prison 




central point from which a permanent gaze may control priso 
and staff. Around these two requirements, several variations 
possible: the Benthamite Panopticon in its strict form, the 
circle, the cross-plan, the star shape. In the midst of all these d 
cussions, the Minister of the Interior in 1841 sums up the fur 
mental principles: ‘The central inspection hall is the pivot of 
system. Without a central point of inspection, surveillance ce; 
to be guaranteed, continuous and general; for it is impossible 
have complete trust in the activity, zeal and intelligence of t 
warder who immediately supervises the cells... The architect mint 
therefore bring all his attention to bear on this object; it is a question 
both of discipline and economy. The more accurate and easy the 
surveillance, the less need will there be to seek in the strength of the 
building guarantees against attempted escape and communication 
between the inmates. But surveillance will be perfect if from a central 
hall the director or head-warder sees, without moving and without 
being seen, not only the entrances of all the cells and even the inside 
of most of them when the unglazed door is open, but also the 
warders guarding the prisoners on every floor... With the formula 
of circular or semi-circular prisons, it would be possible to see from 
a single centre all the prisoners in their cells and the warders in the 
inspection galleries* (Ducatel, 9). I 1 

But the penitentiary Panopticon was also a system of individual¬ 
izing and permanent documentation. The same year in which 
variants of the Benthamite schema were recommended for the 
building of prisons, the system of 'moral accounting* was made 
compulsory: an individual report of a uniform kind in every prison, 
on which the governor or head-warder, the chaplain and the 
instructor had to fill in their observations on each inmate: 'It is in a 
way the vade mecum of prison administration, making it possible to 
assess each case, each circumstance and, consequently, to know 
what treatment to apply to each prisoner individually* (Ducpetiaux, 
56-7). Many other, much more complete, systems of recording were 
planned or tried out (cf., for example, Gregory, I99ff; Grellet- 
Wammy, 23-5 and 199-203). The overall aim was to make the 
prison a place for the constitution of a body of knowledge that 
would regulate the exercise of penitentiary practice. The prison has 
not only to know the decision of the judges and to apply it in terms 


Complete and austere institutions 


.1 the established regulations: it has to extract unceasingly from the 
inmate a body of knowledge that will make it possible to transform 
the penal measure into a penitentiary' operation; which will make of 
(he penalty required by the offence a modification of the inmate that 
will be of use to society. The autonomy of the carceral regime and 
the knowledge that it creates make it possible to increase the utility 
uf the penalty, which the code had made the very principle of its 
punitive philosophy: 'The governor must not lose sight of a single 
Inmate, because in whatever part of the prison the inmate is to be 
found, whether he is entering or leaving, or whether he is staying 
(here, the governor must also justify the motives for his staying in 
a particular classification or for his movement from one to another. 
He is a veritable accountant. Each inmate is for him, in the sphere 
of individual education, a capital invested with penitentiary interest' 
(Lucas, II, 449-50). As a highly efficient technology, penitentiary 
practice produces a return on the capital invested in the penal system 
and in the building of heavy prisons. 

Similarly, the offender becomes an individual to know. This 
demand for knowledge was not, in the first instance, inserted into 
the legislation itself, in order to provide substance for the sentence 
and to determine the true degree of guilt. It is as a convict, as a point 
of application for punitive mechanisms, that the offender is con¬ 
stituted himself as the object of possible knowledge. 

But this implies that the penitentiary apparatus, with the whole 
technological programme that accompanies it, brings about a 
curious substitution: from the hands of justice, it certainly receives 
a convicted person; but what it must apply itself to is not, of course, 
the offence, nor even exactly the offender, but a rather different 
object, one defined by variables which at the outset at least were not 
taken into account in the sentence, for they were relevant only for 
a corrective technology. This other character, whom the peniten¬ 
tiary apparatus substitutes for the convicted offender, is the 
delinquent. 

The delinquent is to be distinguished from the offender by the 
fact that it is not so much his act as his life that is relevant in char¬ 
acterizing him. The penitentiary operation, if it is to be a genuine 
re-education, must become the sum total existence of the delinquent, 
making of the prison a sort of artificial and coercive theatre in which 


15 > 



Prison 


his life will be examined from top to bottom. The legal punishment 
bears upon an act; the punitive technique on a life; it falls to this 
punitive technique, therefore, to reconstitute all the sordid detail of 
a life in the form of knowledge, to fill in the gaps of that knowledge 
and to act upon it by a practice of compulsion. It is a biographical 
knowledge and a technique for correcting individual lives. The 
observation of the delinquent ‘should go back not only to the 
circumstances, but also to the causes of his crime; they must be 
sought in the story of his life, from the triple point of view of 
psychology, social position and upbringing, in order to discover the 
dangerous proclivities of the first, the harmful predispositions of the 
second and the bad antecedents of the third. This biographical 
investigation is an essential part of the preliminary investigation for 
the classification of penalities before it becomes a condition for the 
classification of moralities in the penitentiary system. It must 
accompany the convict from the court to the prison, where the 
governor’s task is not only to receive it, but also to complete, super¬ 
vise and rectify its various factors during the period of detention' 
(Lucas, II, 440-41). Behind the offender, to whom the investigation 
of the facts may attribute responsibility for an offence, stands the 
delinquent whose slow formation is shown in a biographical 
investigation. The introduction of the 'biographical' is important 
in the history of penality. Because it establishes the ‘criminal’ as 
existing before the crime and even outside it. And, for this reason, 
a psychological causality, duplicating the juridical attribution of 
responsibility, confuses its effects. At this point one enters the 
'criminological' labyrinth from which we have certainly not yet 
emerged: any determining cause, because it reduces responsibility, 
marks the author of the offence with a criminality all the more for¬ 
midable and demands penitentiary measures that are all the more 
strict. As the biography of the criminal duplicates in penal practice 
the analysis of circumstances used in gauging the crime, so one sees 
penal discourse and psychiatric discourse crossing each other’s 
frontiers; and there, at their point of junction, is formed the notion 
of the 'dangerous' individual, which makes it possible to draw up a 
network of causality in terms of an entire biography and to present 
a verdict of punishment-correction. 11 

The delinquent is also to be distinguished from the offender in 


252 


Complete and austere institutions 


that he is not only the author of his acts (the author responsible in 
terms of certain criteria of free, conscious will), but is linked to his 
offence by a whole bundle of complex threads (instincts, drives, 
tendencies, character). The penitentiary technique bears not on the 
relation between author and crime, but on the criminal’s affinity with 
his crime. The delinquent, the strange manifestation of an overall 
phenomenon of criminality, is to be found in quasi-natural classes, 
each endowed with its own characteristics and requiring a specific 
treatment, what Marquet-Wasselot called in 1841 the ‘ethnography 
of the prisons’; ‘The convicts are ... another people within the 
same people; with its own habits, instincts, morals' (Marquet- 
Wasselot, 9). We are still very close here to the ‘picturesque’ 
descriptions of the world of the malefactors - an old tradition that 
goes back a long way and gained new vigour in the early nineteenth 
century, at a time when the perception of another form of life was 
being articulated upon that of another class and another human 
species. A zoology of social sub-species and an ethnology of the 
civilizations of malefactors, with their own rites and language, was 
beginning to emerge in a parody form. But an attempt was also 
being made to constitute a new objectivity in which the criminal 
belongs to a typology that is both natural and deviant. Delinquency, 
a pathological gap in the human species, may be analysed as morbid 
syndromes or as great tcratological forms. With Ferrus’s classifica¬ 
tion, we probably have one of the first conversions of the old 
‘ethnography’ of crime into a systematic typology of delinquents. 
The analysis is slender, certainly, but it reveals quite clearly the 
principle that delinquency must be specified in terms not so much 
of the law as of the norm. There are three types of convict; there are 
those who arc endowed ‘with intellectual resources above the average 
of intelligence that we have established’, but who have been perverted 
either by the 'tendencies of their organization’ and a ‘native pre¬ 
disposition', or by ‘pernicious logic', an 'iniquitous morality’, a 
'dangerous attitude to social duties’. Those that belong to this cat¬ 
egory require isolation day and night, solitary exercise, and, when one 
is forced to bring them into contact with the others, they should 
wear 'a light mask made of metal netting, of the kind used for stone- 
cutting or fencing’. The second category is made up of‘vicious, stupid 
or passive convicts, who have been led into evil by indifference to 



Prison 


either shame or honour, through cowardice, that is to say, laziness, 
and because of a lack of resistance to bad incitements’; the reginv 
suitable to them is not so much that of punishment as of education, anil 
if possible of mutual education: isolation at night, work in common 
during the day, conversations permitted provided they are conducted 
aloud, reading in common, followed by mutual questioning, for which 
rewards may be given. Lastly, there are the ‘inept or incapablr 
convicts', who are 'rendered incapable, by an incomplete organiza¬ 
tion, of any occupation requiring considered effort and consistent 
will, and who are therefore incapable of competing in work with 
intelligent workers and who, having neither enough education to 
know their social duties, nor enough intelligence to understand this 
fact or to struggle against their personal instincts, are led to evil by 
their very incapacity. For these, solitude would merely encourage 
their inertia; they must therefore live in common, but in such a way 
as to form small groups, constantly stimulated by collective 
operations, and subjected to rigid surveillance' (Ferrus, 18aff and 
278ff). Thus a ‘positive' knowledge of the delinquents and their 
species, very different from the juridical definition of offences and 
their circumstances, is gradually established; but this knowledge is 
also distinct from the medical knowledge that makes it possible to 
introduce the insanity of the individual and, consequently, to efface 
the criminal character of the act. Ferrus states the principle quite 
clearly: 'Considered as a whole, criminals arc nothing less than 
madmen; it would be unjust to the latter to confuse them with 
consciously perverted men.’ The task of this new knowledge is to 
define the act ‘scientifically’ qua offence and above all the individual 
qua delinquent. Criminology is thus made possible. 

The correlative of penal justice may well be the offender, but the 
correlative of the penitentiary apparatus is someone other; this is the 
delinquent, a biographical unity, a kernel of danger, representing a 
type of anomaly. And, although it is true that to a detention that 
deprives of liberty, as defined by law, the prison added the addi¬ 
tional element of the penitentiary, this penitentiary element intro¬ 
duced in turn a third character who slipped between the individual 
condemned by the law and the individual who carries out this law. 
At the point that marks the disappearance of the branded, dis¬ 
membered, burnt, annihilated body of the tortured criminal, there 

*54 


Complete and austere institutions 


.ppeared the body of the prisoner, duplicated by the individuality 
of the ‘delinquent’, by the little soul of the criminal, which the very 
apparatus of punishment fabricated as a point of application of the 
power to punish and as the object of what is still called today 
penitentiary science. It is said that the prison fabricated delinquents; 
it is true that it brings back, almost inevitably, before the courts those 
who have been sent there. But it also fabricates them in the sense 
that it has introduced into the operation of the law and the offence, 
the judge and the offender, the condemned man and the executioner, 
the non-corporal reality of the delinquency that links them together 
and, for a century and a half, has caught them in the same trap. 


The penitentiary technique and the delinquent are in a sense twin 
brothers. It is not true that it was the discovery of the delinquent 
through a scientific rationality that introduced into our old prisons 
the refinement of penitentiary techniques. Nor is it true that the 
internal elaboration of penitentiary methods has finally brought to 
light the ‘objective’ existence of a delinquency that the abstraction 
and rigidity of the law were unable to perceive. They appeared 
together, the one extending from the other, as a technological 
ensemble that forms and fragments the object to which it applies its 
instruments. And it is this delinquency, formed in the foundations 
of the judicial apparatus, among the 'basses ceuvres ’, the servile tasks, 
from which justice averts its gaze, out of the shame it feels in punish¬ 
ing those it condemns, it is this delinquency that now comes to 
haunt the untroubled courts and the majesty of the laws; it is this 
delinquency that must be known, assessed, measured, diagnosed, 
treated when sentences arc passed. It is now this delinquency, this 
anomaly, this deviation, this potential danger, this illness, this form 
of existence, that must be taken into account when the codes are 
rewritten. Delinquency is the vengeance of the prison on justice. 
It is a revenge formidable enough to leave the judge speechless. 
It is at this point that the criminologists raise their voices. 

But we must not forget that the prison, that concentrated and 
austere figure of all the disciplines, is not an endogenous element in 
the penal system as defined at the turn of the eighteenth and nine¬ 
teenth centuries. The theme of a punitive society and of a general 
semio-technique of punishment that has sustained the ‘ideological’ 


*55 



Prison 


codes - Beccarian or Benthamite - did not itself give rise to thr 
universal use of the prison. This prison came from elsewhere - fr< >iu, 
the mechanisms proper to a disciplinary power. Now, despite tltmi 
heterogeneity, the mechanisms and effects of the prison have spread 
right through modem criminal justice; delinquency and the ddiml 
quents have become parasites on it through and through. One mun 
seek the reason for this formidable ‘efficiency* of the prison. But on# I 
thing may be noted at the outset: the penal justice defined in tlir| 
eighteenth century by the reformers traced two possible but diver J 
gent lines of objectification of the criminal: the first was the $enci| 
of ‘monsters’, moral or political, who had fallen outside the social | 
pact; the second was that of the juridical subject rehabilitated by 
punishment. Now the 'delinquent' makes it possible to join the twrf 
lines and to constitute under the authority of medicine, psychology! 
or criminology, an individual in whom the offender of the law and 
the object of a scientific technique are superimposed - or almost 
one upon the other. That the grip of the prison on the penal system 
should not have led to a violent reaction of rejection is no doubt 
due to many reasons. One of these is that, in fabricating delinquency, 
it gave to criminal justice a unitary field of objects, authenticated 
by the 'sciences*, and thus enabled it to function on a general 
horizon of 'truth*. 

The prison, that darkest region in the apparatus of justice, is the 
place where the power to punish, which no longer dares to manifest 
itself openly, silently organizes a field of objectivity in which 
punishment will be able to function openly as treatment and the 
sentence be inscribed among the discourses of knowledge. It i' 
understandable that justice should have adopted so easily a prison 
that was not the offspring of its own thoughts. Justice certainly owed 
the prison this recognition. 


2. Illegalities and delinquency 


From the point of view of the law, detention may be a mere depriva¬ 
tion of liberty. But the imprisonment that performs this function 
has always involved a technical project. The transition from the 
public execution, with its spectacular rituals, its art mingled with the 
ceremony of pain, to the penalties of prisons buried in architectural 
masses and guarded by the secrecy of administrations, is not a 
transition to an undifferentiated, abstract, confused penality; it is the 
transition from one art of punishing to another, no less skilful one. 
It is a technical mutation. From this transition spring a symptom and 
a symbol: the replacement, in 1837, of the chain-gang by the police 
carriage. 

The chain-gang, a tradition that went back to the time of the 
galley slaves, was still surviving under the July monarchy. The 
importance it seems to have assumed as a spectacle at the beginning 
of the nineteenth century may be bound up with the fact that it 
combined in a single manifestation the two modes of punishment: 
the way to detention unfolded as a ceremonial of torture. (Fauchcr 
remarked that the chain-gang was a popular spectacle ‘especially 
since the scaffolds were almost entirely abolished’.) The accounts of 
the ‘last chain-gangs' - those that crossed France in the summer of 
1836-and of its scandals allow us to rediscover this functioning, so 
alien to the rules of 'penitentiary science’. It began with a scaffold 
ritual: the fixing of iron collars and chains in the courtyard of 
Bicctre prison. The convict’s neck was thrown back upon a block; 
but this time the art of the executioner was to strike without crush¬ 
ing the head - an inverted skill that knew how not to deliver the 
death blow. ‘The courtyard of Bicetre displays its instruments of 
torture: several rows of chains with their iron-collars. The artoupans 
(head-warders), who serve as temporary blacksmiths, arrange the

block and hammer. Around the bars of the wall walk are stuck all 
those heads, wearing a gloomy or bold expression, which the opera¬ 
tor is to rivet. Higher up, at every storey of the prison, one sees legs 
and arms dangling through the bars of the cells, as at some bazaar 
of human flesh; these are the prisoners who have come to assist at 
the toilet of their comrades of the day before. . . Here they are in 
the attitude of sacrifice. They are stilting on the ground, coupled at 
random by the waist; the chains they must carry, each weighing 
eight pounds, rest heavily on their knees. The operator inspects f 
them, measuring heads and adapting the enormous inch-thick 
collars. It takes three men to rivet an iron-collar; the first holds up 
the block, the second holds the two branches of the iron-collar 
together and, with his two outstretched arms, secures the ptient's 
head; the third strikes with repeated blows and flattens the boll 
under his huge hammer. Each blow shakes the head and the body. 

... Indeed, one does not think of the danger that the victim might 
face if the hammer missed its mark; this impression is nullified or 
rather defaced before the profound impression of horror one 
experiences in contemplating one of God’s creatures in such a state 
of abasement.' 1 It also had the dimension of a public spectacle; 
according to the Gazette des tribunaux, over too.ooo people watched 
the chain-gang leave Paris on 19 July: The descent from the Cour- 
tille to the Mardi Gras. . Order and wealth came to watch from a 
distance the passing of the great nomadic tribe that had been put in 
chains, that other species, ‘the race apart that has the privilege of 
populating the convict-ships and prisons'. The spectators of the 
low er classes, as at the time of the public executions, kept up their 
ambiguous exchanges with the convicts, alternating insults, threats, 
words of encouragement, blows, signs of hate or complicity. Some¬ 
thing violent aroused and accompanied the procession abng its 
entire course: anger against a justice that was too severe or too 
indulgent; shouts against the detested criminals; movements in 
favour of prisoners one knew and greeted; confrontations with the 
police: 'During the whole journey from the Fontainebleau barrier, 
groups of enraged spectators hurled insults at Delacollonge: Down 
with the priest, they said, down with that hateful man; he should 
have got his deserts. Without the energy and firmness of the muni¬ 
cipal guard, serious disorders could have taken place. At Vaugirard, 


it was the women who were the most angry. They cried: Down with 
the wicked priest! Down w'ith the monster Delacollonge! The 
police inspectors of Montrougc and Vaugirard and several mayors 
and deputy-mayors ran the gauntlet in their attempt to enforce the 
decision of the courts. Shortly before reaching Issy, Francois, 
recognizing M. Allard and the officers of the brigade, threw his 
w'ooden bowl at them. It was then remembered that the families of 
some of the former comrades of the convict lived at Ivry. From that 
moment the police inspectors spread out along the route and fol¬ 
lowed the convicts’ cart closely. Those of the Paris gang all threw 
their wooden bowls at the heads of the police, some of whom were 
struck. At that moment, the crowd reacted strongly. They started to 
fight amongst themselves’ (Gazette des tribunaux , 20 July 1836). 
Between Bicetre and Sivres a considerable number of houses were 
looted as the chain-gang passed by {La Phalange, 1 August 1836). 

In this festival of the departing convicts, there was something of 
the rites of the scapegoat that is struck as it is chased away, some¬ 
thing of the festival of fools, in which the reversal of roles is prac¬ 
tised, something of the old ceremonies of the scaffold, in which the 
truth must burst forth in the full light of day, something, too, of 
those popular spectacles, in which famous characters or traditional 
types were recognized: the play of truth and infamy, the procession 
of notoriety and shame, invective against the guilty who have been 
unmasked and, on the other hand, the joyous avowal of crimes. One 
sought to rediscover the face of the criminals who had had their 
glory; broadsheets recalled the crimes of those one saw pass; news¬ 
papers provided their names and recounted their lives; sometimes 
they provided a description of their persons and dress, so that their 
identity might not pass unnoticed: like programmes for spectators. 3 
People also came to examine different types of criminals, trying to 
decide, according to facial appearance or dress, the ‘profession’ of 
the convict, whether he was a murderer or thief: it was a game of 
masquerades and marionnettes, which was also, for more educated 
eyes, something of an empirical ethnography of crime. From spec¬ 
tacles on trestles to Gall’s phrenology, according to the milieu to 
which one belonged, one practised the semiologies of crime at one’s 
disposal: ’Physiognomies are as varied as clothes: here a majestic 
head, a Murillo face; there a vicious face, framed with thick eyebrows,

which convey all the energy of the determined villain... Elsewhrr* 
the head of a Fagin emerges from the body of an urchin. Here ar* 
the smooth, feminine features of accomplices; there the gla/ J 
debauched faces of teachers.’ 3 The convicts themselves respon' 

to this game, displaying their crimes and enacting their misde_ 

this was one of the functions of tattooing, a vignette of their deed| 
or their fate: They bear the insignia of their crimes, either a guilt 
tine tattooed on their left arms, or on their chests a dagger plunged 
into a bleeding heart.’ As they passed, they mimed the scenes of their 
crimes, mocking the judges or the police, boasting of as yet un¬ 
discovered deeds of wickedness. Frangois, Lacenaire’s former accom- 
plice, said that he had invented a method for killing a man without 
making him cry out and without spilling a single drop of blood. 
The great travelling fair of crime had its tumblers and its mummers, 
in which the comic affirmation of truth answered curiosity and invec¬ 
tive. A whole series of scenes, in this summer of 1836, took place 
around Dclacollonge: his crime (he had cut his pregnant mistress 
into pieces) was made much more spectacular by the fact that hr 
was a priest; this fact had also saved him from the scaffold. It seems 
that he aroused considerable hate among the people. Earlier, in the 
cart that had brought him to Paris in June 18)6, he had been insulted 
and had been unable to hold back his tears; however, lie had 
expressed a w ish not to be conveyed in a closed carriage, believing 
that the humiliation formed part of his punishment. As he left 
Paris, 'one cannot imagine the virtuous indignation, the moral anger 
and base actions unleashed by the crowd on this man; he was 
covered with earth and mud; stones and insults rained down upon 
him from the furious bystanders. . . It was an explosion of un¬ 
paralleled rage; the women above all, like veritable furies, displayed 
an unbelievable exaltation of hate’ (La Phalange , i August 1836). 
For his protection, his clothes had to be changed. Certain spectators 
were misled by this and thought that Frangois was he. Frangois 
entered into the spirit of the game and accepted the role; but, to the 
comedy of the crime that he did not commit, he added that of the 
priest that he was not; to the account of ’his’ crime, he added the 
prayers and broad gestures of blessing directed at the jeering crowd. 
A few steps away, the real Delacollongc, ‘who seemed like a martyr’, 
was undergoing the double affront of the insults that he was not 


260 


Illegalities and delinquency 


receiving, but which were addressed to him, and the ridicule that 
brought back, under the appearances of another criminal, the priest 
iliat he was and would have liked to have concealed. His passion 
was laid out before his eyes, by a buffoon murderer to whom he was 
(hained. 

In every town it passed through, the chain-gang brought its 
festival with it; it was a saturnalia of punishment, a penalty turned 
into a privilege. And, by a very curious tradition which seems to 
have escaped the ordinary rites of the public execution, it aroused 
in the convict not so much the compulsory marks of repentance as 
the explosion of a mad joy that denied the punishment. To the 
ornaments of the collar and chain, the convicts themselves added 
ribbons, braided straw, flowers or precious stuffs. The chain was the 
round and the dance; it was also a coupling, a forced marriage in 
forbidden love. Wedding, festival and rite in chains: They ran in 
front of the chains, bunches of flowers in their hands, ribbons or 
straw tassels decorated their caps and the most skilful made crested 
helmets. . . Others wore open-work stockings and clogs or a 
fashionable waistcoat, under a workman’s smock.’ 4 And throughout 
the evening that followed the riveting, the chain-gang formed a 
great merry-go-round, which went round and round the courtyard 
of Bic6tre: ’Woe betide the warders if the chain-gang recognized 
them; they were enveloped and drowned in its rings; the prisoners 
remained masters of the field of battle until nightfall.’ 5 The convicts’ 
Sabbath corresponded to the ceremonial of justice through the 
spectacle it invented. It inverted the splendours, the order of power 
and its signs, the forms of pleasure. But something of the political 
Sabbath was not far away. One would have had to be very deaf 
indeed not to hear something of these new accents. The convicts 
sang marching songs, which rapidly became famous and were 
repeated everywhere for a long time after. No doubt an echo was 
to be found in them of the complaints that the broadsheets attributed 
to criminals - an affirmation of the crime, a black heroi7.ation, an 
evocation of terrible punishments and of the general hate that 
surrounded them: ‘Renown, let the trumpets blow for us. . . 
Courage, children, let us submit without fear to the terrible late 
that hangs over our heads. . . Our chains are heavy, but we will 
bear them. For the convicts, no voice rises to say: relieve them of 


Prison 


their suffering.’ Yet there was in those collective songs a totally 
tonality; the moral code, which most of the old complaints obry«^K 
was reversed. Instead of bringing remorse, torture sharpened |>ml# 
the justice that brought the sentence was rejected, and the crn«^B 
that catne to witness what it believed to be repentance or humiluth^B 
was scorned: ‘So far from our homes, we sometimes moan. < W 
stem brows will make our judges blench. . . Avid of misform J 
you turn your eyes upon us, hoping to find a blighted, hcmiliatni,* 
tearful race. But there is pride in our eyes.' One also finds ilA 
assertion that the convict’s life with its companionship has pleasur*^ 
that liberty cannot know. ‘With time let us link our pleasures. Under 
lock and key feast days will be bom. . . Pleasures are turnout* 
They will flee the executioners; they follow where the song leadt,*^ 
And, above all, the present order will not last forever; not only will 
the convicts be freed and resume their rights, but their accusers will 
take their place. Between the criminals and their judges, the day o! 
the great reverse judgement will come: ‘The contempt of men 
belongs to us convicts. The gold they worship is also ours. One day, ! 
this gold will pass into our hands. We will buy it with our live*. 
Others w ill seize these chains that today you make us bear; they will 
become slaves. As we break out of our shackles, the star of liberty J 
will shine for us. . . Farewell, for we brave both your chains and 
your laws.’* The pious theatre imagined by the broadsheets, in 
which the convict exhorted the crowd never to imitate him, wa* 
becoming a threatening scene in which the crowd was asked to 
choose between the barbarity of the executioners, the injustice of the 
judges and the misfortune of convicts who, though defeated today, 
would triumph one day. 

The great spectacle of the chain-gang was linked with the old 
tradition of the public execution; it was also linked w ith that multiple 
representation of crime that gave rise at the time to newspapers, 
broadsheets, mountebanks and street theatres; 7 but it was also linked 
with the confrontations and struggles whose first rumblings it con¬ 
veyed; it gave them a kind of symbolic outlet: though vanquished 
by the law, the army of disorder promised to return; what the 
violence of order had driven away would overthrow that order and 
bring liberty on its return. 'I was horrified to see so many sparks 
reappear in those ashes’ (Le Dernier jour d'un condamni'). The 


Illegalities and delinquency 


•gitation that had always surrounded the public executions now 
i l. .und an echo in precise threats. One can see why the July monarchy 
i decided to abolish the chain-gang for the same - but more pressing - 
I ir.isons that brought about, in the eighteenth century, the abolition 
I ..f the public executions: ‘It is no part of our morality to treat men 
I In this way; one must avoid providing in the towns that the convoy 

I pusses through so hideous a spectacle, which, in any case, teaches 
the population nothing’ (Gazette des tribuneaux, 19 July 1836). It 
u 4$ necessary, therefore, to break with these public rites; to subject 
the movements of convicts to the same mutation as the punishments 
themselves; and to bring them, too, under the veil of administrative 
decency. 

But what, in June 1837, was adopted to replace the chain-gang was 
not the simple covered cart, which had been suggested at one time, 
but a machine that had been very meticulously designed: a carriage 
conceived as a moving prison, a mobile equivalent of the Panopticon. 
A central corridor divided it along its entire length: on either side 
were six cells in which the two rows of convicts sat facing one 
another. Their feet were placed in rings that were lined on the inside 
with wool and linked together by chains eighteen inches long; the 
legs were secured in metal knee-guards. The convict sat on a kind 
of ‘zinc and oak funnel that emptied onto the public way'. I lie cell 
had no window onto the outside; it was completely lined with sheet 
iron; only a ventilator, also of sheet-iron, with holes pierced in it, 
allowed a ‘suitable flow of air'. On the corridor side, the door ol 
each cell was provided with a hatch, divided into two compartment*: 
one for food, the other, covered by a grill, for surveillance. 'Hu 
opening and the oblique direction of the hatches were so arranged 
that the warders had the prisoners constantly in view and heard 
every word they spoke, though the prisoners themselves were 
unable to see or hear one another.' In this way, 'the same carriage 
may, without the slightest inconvenience, contain at one and tin* 
same time a convict and a simple offender, men and women, children 
and adults. Whatever the length of the journey, all would be 
brought to their destination without having been able to perceive 
one another or to speak to one another.' Lastly, the constant sur 
veillance of the two warders, who were each armed with a small oak 
club, 'with thick nails of crushed diamond’ made it possible to 


263 


Prison 


operate a whole system of punishments in conformity with the 
internal regulation of the carriage: a diet of bread and water, thumb¬ 
screws, lack of a cushion that would allow one to sleep, chains on 
both arms. ‘Any reading other than that of books of morality is 
forbidden.’ 

If only for its mildness and speed, this machine ’would have done 
honour to the sensibility of its author’; but its merit lay in the fact 
that it was a veritable penitentiary carriage. By its external effects, 
it had a quite Benthamite perfection: 'In the rapid passage of this 
mobile prison which, on its dark, silent flanks, bears no other 
inscription than the following words - Transport of Convicts - 
there is something mysterious and gloomy, which Bentham requires 
in the carrying out of criminal sentences and which leaves in the 
minds of onlookers a more salutary and lasting impression than the 
sight of those cynical and joyous travellers’ (Gazette des tribwiaux , 
15 June 1837). It also had internal effects; even in a journey lasting 
only a few days (during which the inmates had not been detached 
for a single moment), it functioned as an apparatus of correction. 
One emerged from it astonishingly calm: 'From a moral point of 
view, this transportation, which lasts no more than seventy-two 
hours, is a terrible torture whose effects on the prisoner seem to be 
lasting.’ The convicts themselves support this view: 'In the cell 
carriage, when you don’t sleep, you can only think. And when I 
thought, I came to regret what I had done; in the end, you sec, I 
would have been afraid to mend my ways and I don’t want to.’* 

The panoptic carriage had only a short history. Yet the way in 
which it replaced the chain-gang and the reasons for this replacement 
recapitulated the whole process by which in eighty years penal 
detention replaced public execution as a calculated technique for 
altering individual behaviour. The cell-carriage was an apparatus of 
reform. What replaced the public execution was not a massive 
enclosure, it was a carefully articulated disciplinary mechanism - at 
least in principle. 

For the prison, in its reality and visible effects, was denounced at 
once as the great failure of penal justice. In a very strange way, the 
history' of imprisonment does not obey a chronology in which one 
sees, in orderly succession, the establishment of a penality of deten¬ 


264 


Illegalities and delinquency 


tion, then the recognition of its failure; then the slow rise of projects 
of reform, seeming to culminate in the more or less coherent 
definition of penitentiary technique; then the implementation of this 
project; lastly, the recognition of its successes or its failure. There 
was in fact a telescoping or in any case a different distribution of 
these elements. And, just as the project of a corrective technique 
accompanied the principle of punitive detention, the critique of the 
prison and its methods appeared very early on, in those same years 
1820-45; indeed, it was embodied in a number of formulations 
which - figures apart - are today repeated almost unchanged. 

- Prisons do not diminish the crime rate: they can be extended, 
multiplied or transformed, the quantity of crime and criminals 
remains stable or, worse, increases: 'In France, one calculates at 
about 108,000 the number of individuals who are in a state of flagrant 
hostility to society. The means of repression at one’s disposal are; 
the scaffold, the iron-collar, three convict-ships, 19 maisons centrales , 
86 maisons de justice , 362 maisons d'arret, 2,800 cantonal prisons, 
2,238 cells in police stations. Despite all these, vice goes unchecked. 
The number of crimes is not diminishing ... the number of recidiv¬ 
ists is increasing, rather than declining' (La FraterniU , no. 10, 
February 1842). 

- Detention causes recidivism; those leaving prison have more 
chance than before of going back to it; convicts arc, in a very high 
proportion, former inmates; 38 per cent of those who left the maisons 
centrales were convicted again and 33 per cent of those sent to con¬ 
vict-ships (a figure given by G. dc Rochefoucauld during the debate 
on the reform of the penal code, 2 December 1831, /Irchives parle- 
mentaires , LXXII, 209-10); between 1828 and 1834, out of almost 
35,000 convicted of crime, about 7,400 were recidivists (that is, 
1 out of 47 of those convicted); out of over 200,000 correctionels, 
or petty offenders, almost 35,000 were also recidivists (1 out of 6); 
in all, one recidivist out of 5 8 of those convicted (Ducpetiaux, 1837, 
276ff); in 1831, out of 2,174 of those condemned for recidivism, 350 
had been in convict-ships, 1,682 in maisons centrales , 142 in four 
maisons de correction that followed the same regime as the centrales 
(Ducpetiaux, 1837, 276ff). And the diagnosis became even more 
severe during the July monarchy: in 1835, out of 7,223 convicted 
criminals, 1,486 were recidivists; in 1839, *>749 out of 7,85 8; in 1844, 


Prison 


i,8ai out of 7,195. Among the 980 prisoners at Loos, there were 570 
recidivists and, at Melun, 745 out of 1,008 prisoners (Ferrus, 363-7). 
Instead of releasing corrected individuals, then, the prison wa» 
setting loose a swarm of dangerous delinquents throughout the 
population: ‘7,000 persons handed back each year to society... they 
are 7,000 principles of crime or corruption spread throughout the 
social body. And, when one thinks that this population is constantly 
increasing, that it lives and moves around us, ready to seize every 
opportunity of disorder, to avail itself of every crisis in society to 
try out its strength, can one remain unmoved by such a spectacle?' 
(Beaumont and Tocqueville, 22-3). 

- The prison cannot fail to produce delinquents. It does so by 
the very type of existence that it imposes on its inmates: whether 
they are isolated in cells or whether they are given useless work, 
ior which they will find no employment, it is, in any case, not ‘to 
think of man in society; it is to create an unnatural, useless and dan¬ 
gerous existence’; the prison should educate its inmates, but can a 
system of education addressed to man reasonably have as its object 
to act against the wishes of nature? (Lucas, I, 127 and 130). The 
prison also produces delinquents by imposing violent constraints 
on its inmates; it is supposed to apply the law-, and to teach respect 
for it; but all its functioning operates in the form of an abuse of 
power. The arbitrary power of administration: ‘The feeling of in¬ 
justice that a prisoner has is one of the causes that may make his 
character untamable. When he sees himself exposed in this way to 
suffering, which the law has neither ordered nor envisaged, he 
becomes habitually angry against everything around him; he sees 
every agent of authority as an executioner; he no longer thinks that 
he was guilty: he accuses justice itself' (Bigot Preameneu). Corrup¬ 
tion, fear and the inefficiency of the warders: 'Between 1,000 and 
1,500 convicts live under the surveillance of between thirty and 
forty supervisors, who can preserve some kind of security only by 
depending on informers, that is to say, on the corruption that they 
carefully sow themselves. Who are these warders? Retired soldiers, 
men uninstructed in their task, making a trade of guarding male¬ 
factors’ {La Fraternite, March 1842). Exploitation by penal labour, 
which can in these conditions have no educational character: ‘One 
inveighs against the slave-trade. But are not our prisoners sold, 


2 66 


Illegalities and delinquency 


like the slaves, by entrepreneurs and bought by manufacturers. . . 
Is this how we teach our prisoners honesty? Are they not still more 
demoralized by these examples of abominable exploitation?’ 1 * 

- The prison makes possible, even encourages, the organization 
of a milieu of delinquents, loyal to one another, hierarchized, ready 
to aid and abet'any future criminal act: 'Society prohibits associa¬ 
tions of more than twenty persons ... and it constitutes for itself 
associations of 200, 500, 1,200 convicts in the maisons centrales, 
which are constructed for them ad hoc , and which it divides up for 
their greater convenience into workshops, courtyards, dormitorie s, 
refectories, where they can all meet together. . . And it multiplier 
them across France in such a way that, where there is a prison, 
there is an association — and as many anti-social clubs’ (Moreau 
Christophe, 7). And it is in these clubs that the education of tlw 
young first offender takes place: 'The first desire that is born wllllln 
him will be to learn from his cleverer seniors how to escape the 
rigours of the law; the first lesson will be derived from the 81 tit t 
logic of thieves who regard society as an enemy; the morality will 
be the informing and spying honoured in our prisons; the In 1 
passion to be aroused in him will be to frighten the young mind by 
these monsters that must have been bom in the dungeon and with h 
the pen refuses to name. . . Henceforth he has broken with evn y 
thing that has bound him to society' {L'Almanack populairt dt 
France , 49-56). Fauchcr spoke of 'barracks of crime'. 

- The conditions to which the free inmates are subjected lice < 
sarily condemn them to recidivism: they arc under the surveilUlK* 
of the police; they arc assigned to a particular residence, or forbidden 
others; 'they leave prison with a passport that they must show evn y 
where they go and which mentions the sentence that they hnv. 
served' (Barbe Marbois, 17). Being on the loose, being unable to find 
work, leading the life of a vagabond are the most frequent factor! in 
recidivism. The Gazette des trihunaux , but also the workers’ iUw«i 
papers, regularly cited cases like that of the worker convicted id 
theft, placed under surveillance at Rouen, caught again for tin’ll, 
and whom no lawyers would defend; so he took it upon himself i<< 
speak before the court, told the story of his life, explained how, nil 
leaving prison and forced to reside in a particular place, hr • . 
unable to take up his trade as a gilder, since as an ex-convict he " »« 


267 




Prison 


turned down wherever he went; the police refused him the right to 
seek work elsewhere: he found himself unable to leave Rouen, with 
nothing to do but die of hunger and poverty as a result of this 
terrible surveillance. He went to the town hall and asked for work; 
for eight days he was given work in the cemeteries for fourteen sous 
a day: ‘But,’ he said, ‘I am young, I have a good appetite, 1 eat more 
than two pounds of bread a day at five sous a pound; what can I do 
with fourteen sous to feed myself, wash my clothes and find lodging? 
I was driven to despair, I wanted to become an honest man again; 
the surveillance plunged me back into misfortune. I became dis¬ 
gusted with everything; it was then that I met Lemaitre, who was 
also a pauper; we had to live and wicked thoughts of thieving came 
back to us.' 10 

- Lastly, the prison indirectly produces delinquents by throwing 
the inmate’s family into destitution: 'The same order that sends the 
head of the family to prison reduces each day the mother to destitu¬ 
tion, the children to abandonment, the whole family to vagabondage 
and begging. It is in this way that crime can take root' (Lucas, II, 64). 

It should be noted that this monotonous critique of the prison 
always takes one of two directions: either that the prison was in¬ 
sufficiently corrective, and that the penitentiary technique was still 
at the rudimentary stage; or that in attempting to be corrective it 
lost its power as punishment," that the true penitentiary technique 
was rigour, 11 and that prison was a double economic error directly, 
by its intrinsic cost and, indirectly, by the cost of the delinquency 
that it did not abolish. ,3 The answer to these criticisms was invariably 
the same: the reintroduction of the invariable principles of peniten¬ 
tiary technique. For a century and a half the prison had always been 
offered as its own remedy: the reactivation of the penitentiary 
techniques as the only means of overcoming their perpetual failure; 
the realization of the corrective project as the only method of over¬ 
coming the impossibility of implementing it. 

This is shown conclusively in the fact that the prisoners’ revolts 
of recent weeks* have been attributed to the fact that the reforms 
proposed in 1945 never really took effect; that one must therefore 
return to the fundamental principles of the prison. But these

protest against living conditions. 



Illegalities and delinquency 


principles, of which such wonderful results are still expected today, 
are well enough known: for the past 150 years they have constitm< < I 
the seven universal maxims of the good 'penitential condition'. 

1. Penal detention must have as its essential function the tran'i 
formation of the individual’s behaviour ‘The reform of the convict 
as the principal aim of the penalty is a sacred principle whose formal 
appearance in the domain of science and above all in that of legishi 
tion is quite recent’ ('Congres penitentiaire de Bruxelles’, 1H47). 
And the Amor commission, of May 1945, faithfully repeats: 'The 
penalty that deprives of liberty has as its essential aim the reforma¬ 
tion and social rehabilitation of the convict.’ The principle of 
correction. 

1. Convicts must be isolated or at least distributed according to 
the penal gravity of their act, but above all according to age, mental 
attitude, the technique of correction to be used, the stages of their 
transformation. 'One must take into account, in using methods for 
altering the great physical and moral differences to be found in the 
characters of convicts, their degree of perversity, the unequal 
opportunities for correction that they may offer* (February, 1850). 
1945: 'The distribution in the penitentiary establishments of indivi¬ 
duals serving a light sentence of up to one year is based on sex, 
personality and the degree of perversion of the delinquent.’ The prin¬ 
ciple oj classification. 

3. It must be possible to alter the penalties according to the 
individuality of the convicts, the results that have been obtained, 
progress or relapses. 'Since the principal aim of the penalty is the 
reform of the convict, it is desirable that any convict whose moral 
regeneration is sufficiently assured should be set free’ (Lucas, 1838), 
1945: 'A progressive regime is applied ... with a view to adapting 
the treatment of the prisoner to his attitude and to his degree of 
improvement. This regime stretches from solitary confinement to 
semi-liberty. . . The benefit of parole is extended to all penalties 
involving a term of imprisonment.’ The principle of the modulation 
of penalties. 

4. Work must be one of the essential elements in the transforma¬ 
tion and progressive socialization of convicts. Penal labour 'must 
not be regarded as the complement and as it were an aggravation 
of the penalty, but as a mitigation, of which it is no longer possible 


268 


269 



Prison 


to deprive the prisoner*. It must enable him to learn or to practise a 
trade, and to provide the prisoner and his family with a source «>l 
income (Ducpetiaux, 1857). 1945: ‘Every common-law prisoner 
obliged to work. . . No prisoner may be forced to remain unoccu¬ 
pied.’ The principle of work as obligation and right. 

5. The education of the prisoner is for the authorities both an 
indispensable precaution in the interests of society and an obligation 
to the prisoner. ‘Education alone may serve as a penitentiary 
instrument. The question of penitentiary imprisonment is a question 
of education’ (Lucas, 1838). 1945: ‘The treatment meted out to the 
prisoner, outside any corrupting promiscuity . .. must be directed 
principally to his general and professional instruction and to his 
improvement.’ The principle of penitentiary education. 

6 . The prison regime must, at least in part, be supervised and 
administered by a specialized staff possessing the moral qualities and 
technical abilities required of educators. In 1850, on the subject of 
prison medicine, Ferrus remarked: 'It is a useful addition to all 
forms of imprisonment ... no one could possess more intimately 
than a physician the trust of the prisoners, know their character, 
better, influence their mental attitudes more effectively, while reliev¬ 
ing their physical ills and, by this means, reprimand or encourage 
as he thinks fit.’ 1945: ‘In every penitentiary establishment, there 
functions a social and medico-psychological service.’ The principle 
of the technical supervision of detention. 

7. Imprisonment must be followed by measures of supervision and 
assistance until the rehabilitation of the former prisoner is complete. 
Not only must he be placed under surveillance on leaving prison, 
‘but he must be given help and support' (Boulct and Bcnquorat the 
Chambre dc Paris). 1945: 'Assistance is given to prisoners during 
and after imprisonment with a view to facilitating their rehabilita¬ 
tion.’ The principle of auxiliary institutions. 

Word for word, from one century to the other, the same funda¬ 
mental propositions are repeated. They reappear in each new, hard- 
won, finally accepted formulation of a reform that has hitherto 
always been lacking. The same sentences or almost the same could 
have been borrowed from other ‘fruitful’ periods of reform: the end 
of the nineteenth century and the 'movement of social defence’; or 
again, the last few years, with the prisoners’ revolts.

Illegalities and delinquency 


One must nor, therefore, regard the prison, its ‘failure’ and its 
more or less successful reform as three successive stages. One 
should think rather of a simultaneous system that historically has 
been superimposed on the juridical deprivation of liberty; a fourfold 
system comprising: the additional, disciplinary element of the prison 
- the element of ‘super-power’; the production of an objectivity, a 
technique, a penitentiary ‘rationality’ - the element of auxiliary 
knowledge; the de facto reintroduction, if not actual increase, of a 
criminality that the prison ought to destroy - the element of in¬ 
verted efficiency; lastly, the repetition of a ‘reform’ that is isomor¬ 
phic, despite its ‘idealism’, with the disciplinary functioning of the 
prison - the element of utopian duplication. It is this complex 
ensemble that constitutes the ‘carceral system’, not only the institu¬ 
tion of the prison, with its walls, its staff, its regulations and its 
violence. The carceral system combines in a single figure discourses 
and architectures, coercive regulations and scientific propositions, 
real social effects and invincible utopias, programmes for correcting 
delinquents and mechanisms that reinforce delinquency. Is not the 
supposed failure part of the functioning of the prison? Is it not to 
be included among those effects of power that discipline and the 
auxiliary technology of imprisonment have induced in the apparatus 
of justice, and in society in general, and which may be grouped 
together under the name of‘carceral system'? If the prison-institu¬ 
tion has survived for so long, with such immobility, if the principle 
of penal detention has never seriously been questioned, it is no 
doubt because this carceral system was deeply rooted and carried 
out certain very precise functions. As evidence of this strength and 
immobility, let us take a recent fact: the model prison opened at 
Fleury-Merogis in 1969 simply took over in its overall plan the 
panoptic star-shape that made such a stir in 1836 at the Pctite- 
Roquette. It was the same machinery of power that assumed a real 
body and a symbolic form. But what role was it supposed to play? 

If the law is supposed to define offences, if the function of the 
penal apparatus is to reduce them and if the prison is the instrument 
of this repression, then failure has to be admitted. Or rather - for in 
order to establish it in historical terms, one must be able to measure 
the effects of the penality of detention on the overall level of 


271 


Prison 


criminality - one should be surprised that for the past 150 years the 
proclamation of the failure of the prison has always been acconv 
panied by its maintenance. The only alternative actually envisaged 
was deportation, which England abandoned at the beginning of the 
nineteenth century and which France took up under the Second 
Empire, but rather as a rigorous and distant form of imprisonment. 

But perhaps one should reverse the problem and ask oneself what 
is served by the failure of the prison; what is the use of these different 
phenomena that are continually being criticized; the maintenance of 
delinquency, the encouragement of recidivism, the transformation of 
the occasional offender into a habitual delinquent, the organization 
of a closed milieu of delinquency. Perhaps one should look fer what 
is hidden beneath the apparent cynicism of the penal institution, 
which, after purging the convicts by means of their sentence, con¬ 
tinues to follow them by a whole series of'brandings’ (a surveillance 
that was once de jure and which is today Je facto ; the police record 
that has taken the place of the convict's passport) and which thus 
pursues as a ‘delinquent’ someone who has acquitted himself of his 
punishment as an offender? Can we not sec here a consequence 
rather than a contradiction? If so, one would be forced to suppose 
that the prison, and no doubt punishment in general, is not intended 
to eliminate offences, but rather to distinguish them, to distribute 
them, to use them; that it is not so much that they render docile 
those who are liable to transgress the law, but that they tend to 
assimilate the transgression of the laws in a general tactics of subjec¬ 
tion. Penality would then appear to be a way of handling illegalities, 
of laying down the limits of tolerance, of giving free rein to some, 
of putting pressure on others, of excluding a particular section, of 
making another useful, of neutralizing certain individuals and of 
profiting from others. In short, penality does not simply ‘check’ 
illegalities; it ‘differentiates’ them, it provides them with a general 
‘economy’. And, if one can speak of justice, it is not only because 
the law itself or the way of applying it serves the interests of a class, it 
is also because the differential administration of illegalities through 
the mediation of penality forms part of those mechanisms of domina¬ 
tion. Legal punishments are to be resituated in an overall strategy 
of illegalities. The ‘failure’ of the prison may be understood on this 
basis. 


Illegalities and delinquency 


The general schema of penal reform had taken shape at the end of 
the eighteenth century in the struggle against illegalities: a whole 
equilibrium of tolerance, mutual support and interests which, under 
the Ancien Regime, had maintained the illegalities of different social 
strata side by side, was disturbed. There then emerged the utopia of 
a universally and publicly punitive society in which ceaselessly 
active penal mechanisms would function without delay, mediation 
or uncertainty; one law, doubly ideal because perfect in its calcula¬ 
tions and engraven on the minds of each citizen would stop, at their 
very origin, all practices of illegality. Now, at the turn of the 
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and against the new codes, the 
danger of a new popular illegality arose. Or, to be more precise, 
perhaps the popular illegalities began to develop according to new 
dimensions: those that were introduced by the movements which, 
from the 1780s to the Revolutions of 1848, linked together social 
conflicts, the struggles against the political regimes, the resistance 
to the movement of industrialization, the effects of the economic 
crises. Broadly speaking, there were three characteristic processes. 
First, the development of the political dimension of the popular 
illegalities. This occurred in two ways: hitherto localized practices, 
limited in some sense to themselves (like the refusal to pay taxes and 
rents or to comply with conscription; the violent confiscation of 
hoarded goods; the looting of shops and the forced selling of pro¬ 
ducts at a ’fair price'; confrontations with the representatives of 
power), were able during the Revolution to lead to directly political 
struggles, whose aim was not simply to extract concessions from the 
state or to rescind some intolerable measure, but to change the 
government and the very structure of power. On the other hand, 
certain political movements were explicitly based on existing forms 
of illegality (for example, the royalist agitation of the west and south 
of France used the peasants' rejection of the new laws on property, 
religion and conscription); this political dimension of illegality was 
to become more complex and more marked in the relations between 
the workers’ movement and the republican parties in the nineteenth 
century, in the passage from the workers’ struggles (strikes, pro¬ 
hibited coalitions, illegal associations) to political revolution. In any 
case, on the horizon of these illegal practices - which multiplied with 
ever more restrictive legislation - there emerged struggles of a 


173 




Prison 


strictly political kind; the possible overthrow of power was not 
present in all of them, far from it; but a good many were able to turn 
themselves to account in overall political struggles and sometimes 
even to lead directly to them. 

On the other hand, through the rejection of the law or other 
regulations, it is easy enough to recognize the struggles against those 
who set them up in their own interests: people were no longer 
fighting against the tax farmers, financiers, the king’s agents, pre¬ 
varicating magistrates or bad ministers - all the agents of injustice - 
but against the law itself and the justice whose task it was to apply 
it; against local landowners who introduced new rights; against 
employers who worked together, but forbade workers’ coalitions; 
against entrepreneurs who introduced more machines, lower wages 
and longer working hours, and made the factory regulations more 
and more strict. It was against the new regime of landed property - 
set up by a bourgeoisie that profited from the Revolution - that a 
whole peasant illegality developed. This no doubt assumed its most 
violent forms between Thermidor and the Consulate, but it did not 
disappear then; it was against the new system of the legal exploita¬ 
tion of labour that workers’ illegalities at the beginning of the nine¬ 
teenth century developed: from the most violent such as machine¬ 
breaking, or the most lasting such as the formation of associations, 
to the most everyday, such as absenteeism, abandoning work, 
vagabondage, pilfering raw materials, deception as to the quantity 
and quality of the work completed. A whole scries of illegalities 
was inscribed in struggles in which those struggling knew that 
they were confronting both the law and the class that had im¬ 
posed it. 

Lastly, although it is true that, during the eighteenth century, 
criminality tended towards more specialized forms, inclining more 
and more to the skilful theft, and became, to some extent, the prac¬ 
tice of men on the fringes of society, isolated from a population that 
was hostile to them - one sees, in the last years of the eighteenth 
century, the reconstitution of certain links or the establishment of 
new relations; not, as contemporaries said, that the leaders of popular 
agitation had been criminals, but because the new forms of law, 
the rigours of the labour regulations, the demands either of the 
state, or of the landowners, or of the employers, and the mos: 


274 


Illegalities and delinquency 


detailed techniques of surveillance, increased the occasions of 
offences, and threw to the other side of the law many individuals, who, 
in other conditions, would not have gone over to specialized 
criminality; it is against the background of the new laws of property, 
against the background, too, of unacceptable conscription that a 
peasant illegality developed in the last years of the Revolution, with 
a consequent increase in violence, acts of aggression, thefts, looting 
and even the greater forms of 'political brigandage’; it was also 
against a background of legislation or very heavy regulations (con¬ 
cerning the livrct, or service certificate, rents, hours, absences from 
work) that a workers' vagabondage developed that often crossed 
the boundary into actual delinquency. A whole series of illegal 
practices, which during the previous century had tended to remain 
isolated from one another, now seemed to come together to form a 
new threat. 

There was a threefold diffusion of popular illegalities at the turn 
of the century (quite apart from a quantitative extension that is 
problematic and still uncalculated): their insertion in a general 
political outlook; their explicit articulation on social struggles; a 
communication between different forms and levels of offences. 
These processes may not have reached their full development; 
certainly there did not develop at the beginning of the nineteenth 
century a massive movement of illegality that was both political and 
social. But, in their emerging form and despite their dispersal, they 
were sufficiently marked to serve as a support for the ‘great fear' 
of a people who were believed to be criminal and seditious as a 
whole, for the myth of a barbaric, immoral and outlaw class which, 
from the empire to the July monarchy, haunted the discourse of 
legislators, philanthropists and investigators into working-class life. 
It is these processes that are to be found behind a whole series of 
affirmations that arc quite alien to the penal theory of the eighteenth 
century: that crime is not a potentiality that interests or passions 
have inscribed in the hearts of all men, but that it is almost exclu¬ 
sively committed by a certain social class; that criminals, who were 
once to be met with in every social class, now emerged 'almost all 
from the bottom rank of the social order’ (Comte, 49); that ‘nine 
tenths of murderers, thieves and idlers come from what we have 
called the social base’ (Lauvergne, 337); that it is not crime that 


175 





Prison 


Illegalities and delinquency 


alienates an individual from society, but that crime is itself due rather 
to the fact that one is in society as an alien, that one belongs to that 
'bastardized race’, as Target called it, to that ‘class degraded by 
misery whose vices stand like an invincible obstacle to the generous 
intentions that wish to combat it’ (Bure, 391); that, this being the 
case, it would be hypocritical or naive to believe that the law was 
made for all in the name of all; that it would be more prudent to 
recognize that it was made for the few and that it was brought to 
bear upon others; that in principle it applies to all citizens, but that 
it is addressed principally to the most numerous and least enlight¬ 
ened classes; that, unlike political and civil laws, their application 
does not concern everybody equally (Rossi, I, 31); that in the courts 

society as a whole does not judge one of its members, but that a 
social category with an interest in order judges another that is 
dedicated to disorder: 'Visit the places where people are judged, 
imprisoned or executed. . . One thing will strike you everywhere; 
everywhere you see two quite distinct classes of men, one of which 
always meets on the seats of the accusers and judges, the other on 
the benches of the accused', which is explained by the fact that the 
latter, for lack of resources and education, do not know *how to 
remain within the limits of legal probity’ (Lucas, II, 82); so that the 
language of the law, which is supposed to be universal, is, in this 
respect, inadequate; it must, if it is to be effective, be the discourse 
of one class to another, which has neither the same ideas as it nor 
even the same words: 'How are we, with our prudish, contemptuous 
languages, overloaded with formality, to make ourselves understood 
by those who have never heard anything but the crude, poor, 
irregular, but lively, frank, picturesque dialect of the market, the 
tavern and the fair. . . What language, what method should we use 
when drawing up laws that will act effectively on the uneducated 
minds of those less capable of resisting the temptations of crime?' 
(Rossi, I, 33). Law and justice do not hesitate to proclaim their 
necessary class dissymmetry. 

If this is the case, the prison, apparently ‘failing’, does not miss 
its target; on the contrary, it reaches it, in so far as it gives rise to 
one particular form of illegality in the midst of others, which it is 
able to isolate, to place in full light and to organize as a relatively 
enclosed, but penetrable, milieu. It helps to establish an open illegal¬ 


ity, irreducible at a certain level and secretly useful, at once refrac¬ 
tory and docile; it isolates, outlines, brings out a form of illegality 
that seems to sum up symbolically all the others, but which makes it 
possible to leave in the shade those that one wishes to - or must - 
tolerate. This form is, strictly speaking, delinquency. One should 
not see in delinquency the most intense, most harmful form of 
illegality, the form that the penal apparatus must try to eliminate 
through imprisonment because of the danger it represents; it is 
rather an effect of penality (and of the penality of detention) that 
makes it possible to differentiate, accommodate and supervise 
illegalities. No doubt delinquency is a form of illegality; certainly 
it has its roots in illegality'; but it is an illegality that the ‘carceral 
system’, with all its ramifications, has invested, segmented, isolated, 
penetrated, organized, enclosed in a definite milieu, and to which it 
has given an instrumental role in relation to the other illegalities. 
In short, although the juridical opposition is between legality and 
illegal practice, the strategic opposition is between illegalities and 
delinquency. 

For the observation that prison fails to eliminate crime, one should 
perhaps substitute the hypothesis that prison has succeeded ex¬ 
tremely well in producing delinquency, a specific type, a politically 
or economically less dangerous - and, on occasion, usable - form 
of illegality; in producing delinquents, in an apparently marginal, 
but in fact centrally supervised milieu; in producing the delinquent 
as a pathologizcd subject. The success of the prison, in the struggles 
around the law and illegalities, has been to specify a 'delinquency'. 
We have seen how- the carceral system substituted the 'delinquent’ 
for the offender, and also superimposed upon juridical practice a 
whole horizon of possible knowledge. Now this process that con¬ 
stitutes delinquency as an object of knowledge is one with the 
political operation that dissociates illegalities and isolates delin¬ 
quency from them. The prison is the hinge of these two mechanisms; 
it enables them to reinforce one another perpetually, to objectify the 
delinquency behind the offence, to solidify delinquency in the move¬ 
ment of illegalities. So successful has the prison been that, after a 
century and a half of‘failures', the prison still exists, producing the 
same results, and there is the greatest reluctance to dispense 
with it.

Prison 


The penality of detention seems to fabricate - hence no doubt in 
longevity - an enclosed, separated and useful illegality. The circuit 
of delinquency would seem to be not the sub-product of a prison 
which, while punishing, docs not succeed in correcting; it is rather 
the direct effect of a penality which, in order to control illegal 
practices, seems to invest certain of them in a mechanism of'punish¬ 
ment-reproduction', of which imprisonment is one of the mam 
parts. But why and how is the prison called upon to participate in 
the fabrication of a delinquency that it is supposed to combat? 

The establishment of a delinquency that constitutes somethin# 
like an enclosed illegality has in fact a number of advantages. T< 
begin with, it is possible to supervise it (by locating individuals, 
infiltrating the group, organizing mutual informing): for the vague, 
swarming mass of a population practising occasional illegality, which 
is always likely to spread, or again for those loose bands of vaga« 
bonds, recruiting as they move from place to place, and according 
to circumstances, from die unemployed, beggars, 'bad characters' 
of all kinds, which sometimes reach such proportions - as we saw at 
the end of the eighteenth century - as to form formidable forces for 
looting and rioting, is substituted a relatively small and enclosed 
group of individuals on whom a constant surveillance may fce kept. 
Moreover, it is possible to divert this self-absorbed delinquency tu 
forms of illegality that arc less dangerous: maintained by the pres¬ 
sure of controls on the fringes of society, reduced to precarious 
conditions of existence, lacking links with the population that would 
be able to sustain it (as was once the case with smugglers or certain 
forms of bandits - cf. Hobsbawm), delinquents inevitably fell back 
on a localized criminality, limited in its power to attract popular 
support, politically harmless and economically negligible. Now this 
concentrated, supervised and disarmed illegality is directly useful. 
It may be useful in relation to other illegalities: isolated from them, 
turned inwards upon its own internal organization, dedicated to a 
violent criminality, of which the poorer classes are often the first 
victims, hemmed in on every side by the police, exposed to long 
prison sentences, followed by a permanently ‘specialized’ life - 
delinquency - this alien, dangerous and often hostile world obstructs 
or at least maintains at a sufficiently low level everyday illegal 
practices (petty thefts, minor acts of violence, routine acts of law¬ 


278 


Illegalities and delinquency 


breaking); it prevents them from leading to broader, more obvious 
forms, rather as though the exemplary effect once expected of the 
spectacle of the scaffold was now sought not so much in the rigour 
of the punishments, as in the visible, branded existence of delin¬ 
quency itself: while differentiating itself from other popular illegali¬ 
ties, delinquency serves to keep them in check. 

But delinquency has other direct uses. The example of coloniza¬ 
tion comes to mind. Yet it is not the most convincing example; 
indeed, although the deportation of criminals was demanded on 
several occasions under the Restoration, either by the Chamber of 
Deputies or by the General Councils, this was essentially in order 
to lighten the financial burdens imposed by the whole apparatus of 
detention; and, despite all the projects that were drawn up under the 
July monarchy for delinquents, undisciplined soldiers, prostitutes 
and orphans to take part in the colonization of Algeria, that colony 
was formally excluded, by the law of >854, from becoming one of 
the overseas penal colonies; in fact, deportation to Guiana or later 
to New Caledonia had no real economic importance, despite the 
obligation imposed on the convicts to remain in the colony where 
they had served their sentence for a number of years equal to their 
time of detention (in certain cases, they even had to spend the rest 
of their lives there). 11 In fact, the use of delinquency as a milieu 
that was both separate and manipulate took place above all on the 
fringes of legality, that is to say, a sort of subordinate illegality was 
also set up in the nineteenth century whose organization as delin¬ 
quency, with all the surveillance that this implies, provided a guaran¬ 
tee of docility. Delinquency, controlled illegality, is an agent for the 
illegality of the dominant groups. The setting up of prostitution 
networks in the nineteenth century is characteristic in this respect: 16 
police checks and checks on the prostitutes’ health, their regular 
stay in prison, the large-scale organization of the maisons closes , or 
brothels, the strict hierarchy that was maintained in the prostitution 
milieu, its control by delinquent-informers, all this made it possible 
to canalize and to recover by a whole series of intermediaries the 
enormous profits from a sexual pleasure that an ever-more insistent 
everyday moralization condemned toscmi-clandcstinity and naturally 
made expensive; in setting up a price for pleasure, in creating a 
profit from repressed sexuality and in collecting this profit, the 


279 



Prison 


delinquent milieu was in complicity with a self-interested puritan- 
ism: an illicit fiscal agent operating over illegal practices. 1 * Arm* 
trafficking, the illegal sale of alcohol in prohibition countries, or 
more recently drug trafficking show a similar functioning of tin* 
'useful delinquency': the existence of a legal prohibition create* 
around it a field of illegal practices, which one manages to supervise, 
while extracting from it an illicit profit through elements, themselves 
illegal, but rendered manipulate by their organization in delin¬ 
quency. This organization is an instrument for administering and 
exploiting illegalities. 

It is also an instrument for the illegality with which the very 
exercise of power surrounds itself. The political use of delinquents - 
as informers and agents provocateurs - was a fact well before the 
nineteenth century. 17 But, after the Revolution, this practice 
acquired quite different dimensions: the infiltration of political 
parties and workers’ associations, the recruitment of thugs against 
strikers and rioters, the organization of a sub-police - working 
directly with the legal police and capable if necessary of becoming a 
sort of parallel army - a whole extra-legal functioning of power was 
partly assured by the mass of reserve labour constituted by the 
delinquents: a clandestine police force and standby army at the 
disposal of the state. It seems that, in France, it was around the 
Revolution of 1848 and Louis Napoleon's seizure of power that 
these practices reached their height (Marx, Eighteenth Brumaire ..., 
63-5). Delinquency, solidified by a penal system centred upon the 
prison, thus represents a diversion of illegality for the illicit circuits 
of profit and power of the dominant class. 

The organization of an isolated illegality, enclosed in delinquency, 
would not have been possible without the development of police 
supervision. General surveillance of the population, 'silent, mysteri¬ 
ous, unpcrccivcd vigilance ... it is the eye of the government cease¬ 
lessly open and watching without distinction over all citizens, yet 
without subjecting them to any measure of coercion whatever... It 
does not need to be written into the law' (Bonneville, 1847, 397-9)- 
Surveillance of individuals, envisaged by the code of 1810, of ex¬ 
convicts and of all those who, having appeared before the courts on 
serious charges, were legally presumed to represent a new threat to 
the peace of society. But surveillance, too, of milieux and groups 


280 


Illegalities and delinquency 


regarded as dangerous by informers, almost all of whom were 
former delinquents, supervised as such by the police: delinquency, 
an object among others of police surveillance, is also one of its 
privileged instruments. All these surveillances presuppose the 
organization of a hierarchy, partly official, partly secret (in the Paris 
police, this was essentially the ‘security service’, which comprised, 
apart from its 'open agents’ - inspectors and sergeants - its 'secret 
agents’ and informers, who were motivated by fear of punishment 
or the prospect of reward: cf. Fregier, I, 142-8). They also presup¬ 
pose the setting up of a documentary system, the heart of which 
would be the location and identification of criminals: compulsory 
description of the criminal combined with arrest warrants issued by 
the assize courts,a description included in prison committal registers, 
copies of the registers of assize courts and courts of summary 
jurisdiction sent each month to the Ministries of Justice and of 
General Police, the organization a little later at the Ministry of the 
Interior of a criminal records office with an alphabetical index con¬ 
taining summaries of these registers, the use in about 1833, according 
to the method of'naturalists, librarians, merchants, businessmen’ of 
a system of individual cards or reports, which facilitated the integra¬ 
tion of new data and, at the same time, together with the name of the 
individual under investigation, all the information that might con¬ 
cern him (Bonneville, 1844,92-3) - the appearance of the card-index 
and the constitution of the human sciences arc another invention 
that historians have taken little note of). Delinquency, with the 
secret agents that it procures, but also with the generalized policing 
that it authorizes, constitutes a means of perpetual surveillance of 
the population: an apparatus that makes it possible to supervise, 
through the delinquents themselves, the whole social field. Delin¬ 
quency functions as a political observatory. In their turn, the statis¬ 
ticians and the sociologists have made use of it, long after the police. 

But this surveillance has been able to function only in conjunction 
with the prison. Because the prison facilitates the supervision of 
individuals when they are released, because it makes possible the 
recruiting of informers and multiplies mutual denunciations, because 
it brings offenders into contact with one another, it precipitates the 
organization of a delinquent milieu, closed in upon itself, but easily 
supervised: and all the results of non-rehabilitation (unemployment, 





Prison 


prohibitions on residence, enforced residences, probation) make ii 
all too easy for former prisoners to carry out the tasks assigned 
to them. Prison and police form a twin mechanism; together they 
assure in the whole field of illegalities the differentiation, isolation 
and use of delinquency. In the illegalities, the police-prison system 
segments a manipulate delinquency. This delinquency, with its 
specificity, is a result of the system; but it also becomes a part and 
an instrument of it. So that one should speak of an ensemble whose 
three terms (police-prison-delinquency) support one another and 
form a circuit that is never interrupted. Police surveillance provides 
the prison with offenders, which the prison transforms into delin¬ 
quents, the targets and auxiliaries of police supervisions, which 
regularly send back a certain number of them to prison. 

There is no penal justice intended to prosecute all illegal practices 
which, to do so, would use the police as an auxiliary and prison as a 
punitive instrument, and not leave in its wake the unassimilablr 
residue of‘delinquency’. One should regard this justice as an instru¬ 
ment for the differential supervision of illegalities. In relation to this 
instrument, criminal justice plays the role of legal surety and prin¬ 
ciple of transmission. It is a relay in a general economy of illegalities, 
whose other elements are (not below it, but beside it) the police, the 
prison and delinquency. Police encroachment on justice and the 
force of inertia that the carceral institution opposes to justice are not 
new, nor are they the result of a sclerosis or of a gradual shift in 
power; it is a structural feature that characterizes punitive mechan¬ 
isms in modern societies. The magistrates can say what they like; 
penal justice, with all its theatrical apparatus, is intended to respond 
to the daily demand of an apparatus of supervision half submerged 
in the darkness in which police and delinquency arc brought to¬ 
gether. Judges are the scarcely resisting employees of this appara¬ 
tus. 1 * They assist as far as they can in the constitution of delinquency, 
that is to say, in the differentiation of illegalities, in the supervision, 
colonization and use of certain of these illegalities by the illegality 
of the dominant class. 

Two figures stand out as representative of this process, which 
developed in the first thirty or forty years of the nineteenth century. 
First, there was Vidocq (cf. his Mimoirts and Histoire de Vidocq 
raconrfe par lui-mimt). He was a man of the old illegalities, a Gil

Illegalities and delinquency 

Bias of the other end of the century, who soon took a turn for the 
worse: disturbances, adventures, swindlings, of which he was 
usually himself the victim, brawls and duels; successive enlistments 
and desertions, contacts with prostitution, gambling, pickpocketing 
and soon large-scale brigandage. But the almost mythical importance 
that he assumed in the eyes of his contemporaries was based not on 
this, perhaps embellished past; it was not even based on the fact that, 
for the first time in history, a former inmate of a convict-ship, 
redeemed or quite simply bought, became a chief of police, but 
rather on the fact that, in him, delinquency visibly assumed its 
ambiguous status as an object and instrument for a police apparatus 
that worked both against it and with it. Vidocq marks the moment 
when deliquency, detached from other illegalities, was invested by 
power and turned inside out. It was then that the direct, institutional 
coupling of police and delinquency took place: the disturbing 
moment when criminality became one of the mechanisms of power. 
A figure had haunted earlier times, that of the monstrous king, the 
source of all justice and yet besmirched with crime; another fear 
now appeared, that of some dark, secret understanding between 
those who enforced the law and those who violated it. The Shake¬ 
spearian age when sovereignty confronted abomination in a single 
character had gone; the everyday melodrama of police power and of 
the complicities that crime formed with power was soon to begin. 

Opposite Vidocq stood his contemporary, Lacenaire. His pres¬ 
ence, assured for ever in the paradise of the aesthetes of crime, is 
surprising enough: despite all his good will, his neophyte’s zeal, he 
was only able to commit, and even then with a singular lack of skill, 
no more than a few minor crimes; he was so strongly suspected of 
being a police spy that the administration had to protect him against 
his fellow prisoners, who tried to kill him (the charge was formally 
taken up by Canlcr, 15), and it was the fashionable society of Louis- 
Philippc’s Paris that gave him, before his execution, a feast beside 
which many a later literary resurrection has been little more than 
academic homage. His fame owed nothing either to the extent of his 
crimes or to the art of their conception; it was their ineptitude that 
gave cause for surprise. But it did owe a great deal to the visible 
play, in what he did and what he said, between illegality and delin¬ 
quency. Swindling, desertion, petty theft, imprisonment, the revival 


283 



Prison 


of friendships made in prison, mutual blackmail, recidivism, up to 
the last, failed attempt at murder - Lacenaire is the typical ‘delin¬ 
quent’. But he brought with him, at least potentially, a horizon of 
illegalities that had, until quite recently, represented a threat: this 
ruined petty bourgeois, of good education, would, a generation 
earlier, have been a revolutionary, a Jacobin, a regicide; 1 * had he been 
a contemporary of Robespierre, his rejection of the law would have 
taken a directly political form. Born in 1800, at more or less the 
same time as Stendhal’s Julien Sorel, his character bears the trace 
of these possibilities; but they took the form of theft, murder and 
denunciation. All these potentialities became a delinquency of no 
great moment: in this sense, Lacenaire is a reassuring character. 
And if these potentialities reappear, it is in what he says about the 
theory of crime. At the moment of his death, Lacenaire manifested 
the triumph of delinquency over illegality, or rather the figure of an 
illegality, on the one hand, dragged down into delinquency, and, 
on the other, displaced towards an aesthetics of crime, that is to say, 
towards an art of the privileged classes. There is a symmetry be¬ 
tween Lacenaire and Vidocq, who in the same period, made it 
possible to turn delinquency in upon itself by constituting it as an 
enclosed, observable milieu and by displacing towards police tech¬ 
niques a whole delinquent practice that was becoming the licit 
illegality of power. That the Parisian bourgeoisie should have 
feasted Lacenaire, that his cell should have been open to famous 
visitors, that he should have been showered with praise during the 
last days of his life, he whose death his plebeian fellow prisoners had 
demanded before his judges had done so, he who had done every¬ 
thing, in court, to bring his accomplice Francois to the scaffold, 
there was a reason for all this: what was being celebrated was the 
symbolic figure of an illegality kept within the bounds of delin¬ 
quency and transformed into discourse - that is to say, made doubly 
inoffensive; the bourgeoisie had invented for itself a new pleasure, 
which it has still far from outgrown. It should not be forgotten that 
Lacenaire’s celebrated death succeeded in muffling the echoes of 
Ficschi's attempt on the life of Louis-Philippe; Fieschi, one of the 
most recent of the regicides, represented the converse figure of a 
petty criminality leading to political violence. Nor should we forget 
that it took place a few months before the departure of the last 


284 


Illegalities and delinquency 


chain-gang and the scandalous demonstrations that accompanied it. 
These two festivals overlapped in history; and, indeed, Francois, 
Lacenaire’s accomplice, was one of the best-known characters in the 
chain-gang of 19 July. 20 The one extended the ancient rituals of the 
public execution at the risk of reactivating popular illegalities around 
the criminals. It was to be prohibited, for the criminal was no longer 
to occupy any other space than that appropriate to delinquency. 
The other inaugurated the theoretical play of an illegality of the 
privileged; or rather it marked the moment when the political and 
economic illegalities actually practised by the bourgeoisie were to 
be duplicated in theoretical and aesthetic representation: the ‘Meta¬ 
physics of crime', a term often associated with Lacenaire. The French 
translation of De Quincey’s Murder Considered as One of the Fine 
Arts was published in 1849. 

This production of delinquency and its investment by the penal 
apparatus must be taken for what they are: not results acquired once 
and for all, but tactics that shift according to how closely they reach 
their target. The split between delinquency and other illegalities, the 
way in which it is turned back upon them, its colonization by the 
dominant illegality - these all appear clearly in the way in which the 
police-prison system functions; yet they have always met with 
resistance; they have given rise to struggles and provoked reaction. 
Erecting the barrier to separate delinquents from all the lower strata 
of the population from which they sprang and with which they 
remained linked has been a difficult task, especially no doubt in 
urban milieux. 21 It has been a long and arduous undertaking. It has 
involved the use of the general principles of the 'moralization' of the 
poorer classes that elsewhere has had such crucial importance both 
from an economic and a political point of view (the acquisition of 
what might be called a 'basic legalism’, which was indispensable 
from the time when custom was replaced by the system of the code; 
learning the elementary rules of property and thrift; training in 
docility at work, in stability of residence and of the family, etc.). 
More specific methods were used to maintain the hostility of the 
poorer classes to delinquents (the use of ex-convicts as informers, 
police spies, strike-breakers or thugs). There has been a systematic 
confusion between offences against common law and those offences 

285 


Prison 


against the severe legislation concerning the livret (work record), 
strikes, coalitions, associations,* 1 for which the workers demanded 
political status. Workers' action was regularly accused of being 
animated, if not manipulated, by mere criminals (cf., for example, 
Monfalcon, 142). Verdicts were often more severe against workers 
than against thieves (cf. L’Atelier, October 1840, or La Fraternity 
July-August 1847). The two categories of convict were mixed in 
the prisons and preferential treatment given to common- law 
offenders, while convicted journalists and politicians usually enjoyed 
the right to separate treatment. In short, a whole tactic of confusion 
aimed at maintaining a permanent state of conflict. 

To this was added a patient attempt to impose a highly specifi. 
grid on the common perception of delinquents: to present them as 
close by, everywhere present and everywhere to be feared. This was 
the function of the fait divers, which invaded a part of the press and 
which began to have its own newspapers.* 3 The criminal fait divers, 
by its everyday redundancy, makes acceptable the system of judicial 
and police supervisions that partition society; it recounts from day 
to day a sort of internal battle against the faceless enemy; in this war, 
it constitutes the daily bulletin of alarm or victory. The crime novel, 
which began to develop in the broadsheet and in mass-circulation 
literature, assumed an apparently opposite role. Above all, its func¬ 
tion was to show that the delinquent belonged to an entirely different 
world, unrelated to familiar, everyday life. This strangeness was first 
that of the lower depths of society ( Les Mysteres de Paris, Rocam¬ 
bole), then that of madness (especially in the latter half of the cen¬ 
tury) and lastly that of crime in high society (Arsi-ne Lupin). The 
combination of the fait divers and the detective novel has produced 
for the last hundred years or more an enormous mass of 'crime 
stories’ in which delinquency appears both as very close and quite 
alien, a perpetual threat to everyday life, but extremely distant ;n its 
origin and motives, both everyday and exotic in the milieu in which 
it takes place. Through the importance attributed to it and the 
surfeit of discourse surrounding it, a line is traced round it w-liich, 
while exalting it, sets it apart. In such a formidable delinquency, 
coming from so alien a clime, what illegality could recognize itself?... 

This multiple tactic had its effect: this is proved by the campaign 
of the workers' newspapers against penal labour;* 1 against the 'corn- 


286 


Illegalities and delinquency 


fort of die prisons' and for giving prisoners the hardest and most 
dangerous work; against the excessive interest shown by philan- 
diropists in die delinquents; against the literature that exalts crime;* 5 
it is also proved by the general mistrust felt dirougliout the workers' 
movement for former common-law convicts. ‘At the dawn of the 
twentieth century,' writes Michele Perrot, ‘surrounded by contempt, 
the highest of walls, the prison finally closed in on an unpopular 
people' (Perrot). 

Yet it certainly cannot be said that this tactic triumphed or that 
it brought about a total break between the delinquents and the lower 
classes. The relations between the poorer classes and illegality, the 
reciprocal position of the proletariat and the urban plebs has yet to 
be studied. But one thing is certain: delinquency and repression 
were regarded, in the w-orkers' movements of the years 1830-50, 
as an important issue. There was no doubt hostility towards the 
delinquents; but it w^as a battle around penality. The workers’ news¬ 
papers often proposed a political analysis of criminality that con¬ 
tradicted term by term the description familiar to the philanthropists 
(poverty - dissipation - laziness - drunkenness - vice - theft - 
crime). They assigned the origin of delinquency not to the indivi¬ 
dual criminal (he was merely the occasion or the first victim), but 
to society: ‘The man who kills you is not free not to kill you. It is 
society or, to be more precise, bad social organization that is 
responsible' ( L‘Humaritaire , August 1841). This is so either because 
society is incapable of providing its fundamental needs, or because 
it destroys or effaces in him possibilities, aspirations or needs that 
later emerge in crime: ‘Bad education, unused aptitudes and forces, 
the intelligence and the heart crushed by forced labour at too tender 
an age’ ( La Fraternity, November 1845). But this criminality of need 
or of repression masks, by the attention paid to it and the disappro¬ 
bation surrounding it, another criminality that is sometimes its 
cause and always its extension. This is the delinquency from above, 
a scandalous example, the source of misery and the principle of 
revolt for the poor. 'While misery strews your streets with corpses, 
and fills your prisons with thieves and murderers, where are the 
swfindlers of the fashionable w-orld?.. . The most corrupting 
examples, the most revolting cynicism, the most shameless robbery. 

... Are you not afraid that the poor man put into the dock for

snatching a piece of bread from a baker’s stall will not, ore day, 
become so enraged that stone by stone he will demolish the Stock 
Exchange, a wild den where the treasure of the state and the fortune 
of families arc stolen with impunity. 1 ' {La Ruche populaire , Novem¬ 
ber 1842). But this delinquency of wealth is tolerated by the laws, 
and, when it does find its way into the courts, it can depend upon 
the indulgence of the judges and the discretion of the press.* 6 Hence 
the idea that criminal trials may become the occasion for a political 
debate, that advantage should be taken of controversial trials or 
proceedings instituted against workers to denounce the general 
functioning of penal justice: ‘The courts are no longer as they once 
were a place for the exhibition of the miseries and wounds of the 
time, a kind of branding in which the sad victims of our social dis¬ 
order are displayed side by side; it is an arena that echoes with the 
cry of combatants' {La Fraternity November 1841). Hence, too, the 
idea that political prisoners, since they have, like delinquents, a 
direct experience of the penal system, but, unlike them, arc in a 
position to be heard, have a duty to be the spokesmen of all pri¬ 
soners; it is their task to enlighten 'the good bourgeois of France, 
who has never known the penalties inflicted through the pompous 
indictments of a public prosecutor’ {Almanach populaire tU la 
France , 1839, 50). 

In this reappraisal of penal justice and of the frontier that it 
carefully traces around delinquency, the tactic of what might be 
called the 'counter-yin/ divers is characteristic. What the workers' 
newspapers do is to reverse the use that was made of crimes or trials 
in the newspapers which, like the Gazette des trihunaux, 'gorge 
themselves with blood’, 'feed on prison' and provide a daily ‘reper¬ 
toire of melodrama’ {Pauvre Jacques , 1st year, no. 3). The counter- 
fait divers systematically stresses the facts of delinquency in the 
bourgeoisie, showing that it is the class affected by 'physical degen¬ 
eration’ and 'moral decay'; for the accounts of crimes committed 
by ordinary people it substitutes descriptions of the misery into 
which their exploiters plunge them and who, literally, starve and 
murder them; 27 it points out in the criminal trials of workers what 
share of responsibility must be attributed to the employers and to 
society as a whole. In short, a whole effort was being made to 
reverse this monotonous discourse on crime, which sought both to 


288 


Illegalities and delinquency 


isolate it as a monstrosity and to depict it as the work of the poorest 
class. 

In the course of this anti-penal polemic, the Fourierists no doubt 
went further than any of the others. They were perhaps the first to 
elaborate a political theory which, at the same time, places a positive 
value on crime. Although, in their view, crime is a result of‘civiliza¬ 
tion’, it is also, and by that very fact, a weapon against it. It bears 
within it a figure and a future. 'The social order dominated by 
the fatality of its repressive principle continues to kill ihrough the 
executioner or through the prisons those whose natural robustness 
rejects or disdains its prescriptions, those who, too strong to remain 
enclosed within its tight swaddling-clothes, break from them and 
tear them to pieces, men who do not wish to remain children’ {La 
Phalange, to January 1837). There is not, therefore, a criminal 
nature, but a play of forces which, according to the class to which 
individuals belong,*• will lead them to power or to prison: if born 
poor, today’s magistrates would no doubt be in the convict-ships; 
and the convicts, if they had been well born, 'would be presiding 
in the courts and dispensing justice’ {La Phalange, 1 December 
1838). At bottom, the existence of crime manifests 'a fortunate 
impressibility of human nature'; it should be seen not so much as 
a weakness or a disease, as an energy that is reviving, an ‘outburst 
of protest in the name of human individuality’, which no doubt 
accounts for its strange power of fascination. 'Without crime, which 
awakens in us a mass of torpid feelings and half distinguished 
passions, we would remain still longer in disorder, in weakness’ 
{La Phalange, 10 January 1837). It may be, therefore, that crime 
constitutes a political instrument that could prove as precious for 
the liberation of our society as it has been for the emancipation of 
the Negroes; indeed, will such an emancipation take place without 
it? 'Poison, fire-raising and sometimes even revolt are evidence of 
the terrible miseries of the social condition’ {La Phalange, to 
January 1837). And what of the prisoners, ‘the most unfortunate 
and most oppressed part of mankind'? La Phalange sometimes 
shared the contemporary aesthetic of crime, but in a very different 
cause. 

Hence a use of fait divers that v/as intended not only to turn the 
reproach of immorality back upon the adversary, but to reveal the 




Prison 


play of opposing forces. La Phalange analyses penal affairs as j 
confrontation coded by ‘civilization’, the great crimes not 
monstrosities, but as the fatal return and revolt of what is repressed,*• 
the minor illegalities not as the necessary’ margins of society, but a* 
a rumbling from the midst of the battle-field. 

After Vidocq and Lacenaire, a third character must be introduced. 
He made only a short appearance; his notoriety lasted hardly more 
than a day. He was merely the passing figure of minor illegalities: a 
child of thirteen, without home or family, charged with vagabond¬ 
age and whom a two-year sentence had no doubt long placed in the 
circuits of delinquency. He would certainly have passed without 
trace, had he not opposed to the discourse of the law that made him 
delinquent (in the name of the disciplines, even more than in the 
terms of the code) the discourse of an illegality that remained resist¬ 
ant to these coercions and which revealed indiscipline in a systematic¬ 
ally ambiguous manner as the disordered order of society and as the 
affirmation of inalienable rights. All the illegalities that the court 
defined as offences the accused reformulated as the affirmation of a 
living force: the lack of a home as vagabondage, the lack of a master 
as independence, the lack of work as freedom, the lack of a time-table 
as the fullness of days and nights. This confrontation of illegality 
with the discipline-pcnality-delinqucncy system was perceived by 
contemporaries or rather by the journalist who happened to be there 
as the comic effect of the criminal law at grips with the petty details 
of indiscipline. And it was true: the affair itself and the verdict that 
followed represented the heart of the problem of legal punishment 
in the nineteenth century. The irony with which the judge tned to 
envelop indiscipline in the majesty of the law and the insolence 
with which the accused reinscribed indiscipline among the funda¬ 
mental rights represent for penality an exemplary scene. 

This, no doubt, is the value of the account published in the 
Ga\ette des iribunaux for August 1840: ‘The judge: One must sleep 
at home. - B£assc: Have I got a home? - You live in perpetual vaga¬ 
bondage. — 1 work to earn my living. - What is your station in 
life? - My station: to begin with, I'm thirty-six at least; I don’t work 
for anybody. I’ve worked for myself for a long time now. I have my 
day station and my night station. In the day, for instance, I hand out 
leaflets free of charge to all the passers-by; I run after the stage¬ 


illegalities and delinquency 


coaches when they arrive and carry luggage for the passengers; I 
turn cart-wheels on the avenue de Neuilly; at night there are the 
shows; I open coach doors, I sell pass-out tickets; I’ve plenty to do. 

- It would be better for you to be put into a good house as an 
apprentice and learn a trade. - Oh, a good house, an apprenticeship, 
it’s too much trouble. And anyway the bourgeois . . . always 
grumbling, no freedom. - Does not your father wish to reclaim you? 

- Haven't got no father. - And your mother? - No mother neither, 
no parents, no friends, free and independent.’ Hearing his sentence 
of two years in a reformatory, Beassc ‘pulled an ugly face, then, 
recovering his good humour, remarked: "Two years, that’s never 
more than twenty-four months. Let’s be off, then.” ’ 

It was this scene that La Phalange took up. And the importance 
that the newspaper gave it, the extremely slow, careful analysis, 
shows that the Fourierists saw in such an everyday affair a play of 
fundamental forces. On the one hand, that of ‘civilization’, repre¬ 
sented by the judge, ‘living legality, the spirit and letter of the law’. 
It had its own system of coercion, which seemed to be the code, 
but which in fact was discipline. There had to be a place, a location, 
a compulsory insertion: 'One sleeps at home, said the judge, because 
in fact, for him, everything must have a home, some dwelling, how¬ 
ever magnificent or mean; his task is not to provide one, but to 
force every individual to live in one.’ Moreover, one must have a 
station in life, a recognizable identity, an individuality fixed once 
and for all: ‘What is your station? This question is the simplest 
expression of the established order in society; such vagabondage is 
repugnant to it, disturbs it; one must have a stable, continuous long¬ 
term station, thoughts of the future, of a secure future, in order to 
reassure it against all attacks.’ In short, one should have a master, 
be caught up and situated within a hierarchy; one exists only when 
fixed in definite relations of domination: ‘Who do you work with? 
That is to say, since you are not a master, you must be a servant, 
whatever your station; it is not a question of your satisfactoriness as 
an individual; it is a question of order to be maintained.’ Confronted 
with discipline on the face of the law, there is illegality, which puts 
itself forward as a right; it is indiscipline, rather than the criminal 
offence, that causes the rupture. An indiscipline of language: 
incorrect grammar and the tone of the replies ‘indicate a violent 


291 








Prison 


split between the accused and society, which, through the judyr, 
addresses him in correct terms'. An indiscipline that is the indisci. 
pline of native, immediate liberty: 'He is well aware that the appren¬ 
tice, the worker is a slave and that slavery is sad. . . This liberty, 
this need of movement that possesses him, he is well aware that he 
would no longer enjoy it in a life of ordinary order. . . He prefer* 
liberty; what does he care if others see it as disorder? It is liberty, 
that is to say, the most spontaneous development of his individual¬ 
ity, a wild development and, consequently, brutal and limited, but j 
natural, instinctive development.’ Indiscipline in family relations; 
it does not matter whether this lost child was abandoned or freed 
himself voluntarily, for ‘he would have been unable to bear the 
slavery of education either at his parents' or with strangers'. And 
through all these minute disciplines it is ultimately ‘civilization’ as a 
whole that is rejected and ‘wildness’ that emerges: 'It is work, it i> 
laziness, it is thoughtlessness, it is debauchery: it is everything except 
order; the difference in occupations and debauches aside, it is the 
life of the savage, living from day to day and with no tomorrow’ 
(La Phalange, 15 August 1840). 

No doubt the analyses of La Phalange cannot be regarded as 
representative of the discussions that took place in the workers' press 
at this time on crime and penality. Nevertheless, they are situated in 
the context of this polemic. The lessons of La Phalange were not 
quite wasted. They found an echo when, in the second half of the 
nineteenth century, taking the penal apparatus as their point of 
attack, the anarchists posed the political problem of delinquency; 
when they thought to recognize in it the most militant rejection of 
the law; when they tried not so much to heroize the revolt of the 
delinquents as to disentangle delinquency from the bourgeois legality 
and illegality that had colonized it; when they wished to re-establish 
or constitute the political unity of popular illegalities.

). The carceral 


Were I to fix the date of completion of the carceral system, I would 
choose not 1810 and the penal code, nor even 1844, when the law 
laying down the principle of cellular internment was passed; I might 
not even choose 1838, when books on prison reform by Charles 
Lucas, Moreau-Christophe and Faucher were published. The date I 
would choose would be 22 January 1840, the date of the official 
opening of Mettray. Or better still, perhaps, that glorious day, 
unremarked and unrecorded, when a child in Mettray remarked as 
he lay dying: ’What a pity I left the colony so soon’ (Ducp£tiaux, 
1852, 383). This marked the death of the first penitentiary saint. 
Many of the blessed no doubt went to join him, if the former 
inmates of the penal colonics are to be believed when, in singing 
the praises of the new punitive policies of the body, they remarked: 
'We preferred the blows, but the cell suits us better.’ 

Why Mettray? Because it is the disciplinary form at its most 
extreme, the model in which arc concentrated all the coercive 
technologies of behaviour. In it were to be found 'cloister, prison, 
school, regiment’. The small, highly hierarchized groups, into which 
the inmates were divided, followed simultaneously five models: that 
of the family (each group was a ‘family’ composed of'brothers’ and 
two ‘elder brothers’); that of the army (each family, commanded by 
a head, was divided into two sections, each of which had a second 
in command; each inmate had a number and was taught basic 
military exercises; there was a cleanliness inspection every day, an 
inspection of clothing every week; a roll-call was taken three times 
a day); that of the workshop, with supervisors and foremen, who 
were responsible for the regularity of the work and for the appren¬ 
ticeship of the younger inmates; that of the school (an hour or an 
hour and a half of lessons every day; the teaching was given by the 


293 



Prison 


instructor and by the deputy-heads); lastly, the judicial model (eaclfl 
day ‘justice' was meted out in the parlour ‘The least act of cli*. < 
obedience is punished and the best way of avoiding serious offence* I 
is to punish the most minor offences very severely: at Mettray, a u\e- I 
less word is punishable’; the principal punishment inflicted wa J 
confinement to one’s cell; for ‘isolation is the best means of acting oil h 
the moral nature of children; it is there above all that the voice <*| 
religion, even if it has never spoken to their hearts, recovers all it«l 
emotional power' - Ducpetiaux, 1852, 377); the entire parapcrul I 
institution, which is created in order not to be a prison, culminate* 
in the cell, on the walls of which are written in black letters: 'God 
sees you.’ 

This superimposition of different models makes it possible 10 
indicate, in its specific features, the function of'training'. The chid* 
and their deputies at Mettray had to be not exactly judges, or 
teachers, or foremen, or non-commissioned officers, or 'pareni%', I 
but something of all these things in a quite specific mode of inter¬ 
vention. They were in a sense technicians of behaviour: engineer* 
of conduct, orthopaedists of individuality. Their task was to produce < 
bodies that were both docile and capable; they supervised the nine 
or ten working hours of every day (whether in a workshop or in 
the fields); they directed the orderly movements of groups of in¬ 
mates, physical exercises, military exercises, rising in the morning, ! 
going to bed at night, walks to the accompaniment of bugle and 
whistle; they taught gymnastics; 1 they checked cleanliness, super¬ 
vised bathing. Training was accompanied by permanent observa- I 
tion; a body of knowledge was being constantly built up from the 
everyday behaviour of the inmates; it was organized as an instrument 
of perpetual assessment: ‘On entering the colony, the child is sub¬ 
jected to a sort of interrogation as to his origins, the position of his 
family, the offence for which he was brought before the courts and 
all the other offences that make up his short and often very sad 
existence. This information is written down on a board on which 


everything concerning each inmate is noted in turn, his stay at the 
colony and the place to which he is sent when lie leaves' (Dacpeti- 
aux, 1851, 61). The modelling of the body produces a knowledge 
of the individual, the apprenticeship of the techniques induces modes 
of behaviour and the acquisition of skills is inextricably linked w'ith 


294 


The carceral 


the establishment of power relations; strong, skilled agricultural 
workers are produced; in this very work, provided it is technically 
supervised, submissive subjects are produced and a dependable 
body of knowledge built up about them. This disciplinary technique 
exercised upon the body had a double effect: a ‘soul’ to be known 
and a subjection to be maintained. One result vindicated this work of 
training: in 1848, at a moment when ‘the fever of revolution fired the 
imagination of all, when the schools at Angers, La Flftche, Alfort, 
even the boarding schools, rose up in rebellion, the inmates of 
Mettray were calmer than ever’ (Ferrus). 

Where Mettray w'as especially exemplary was in the specificity 
that it recognized in this operation of training. It was related to 
other forms of supervision, on which it was based: medicine, general 
education, religious direction. But it cannot not be identified abso¬ 
lutely with them. Nor with administration in the strict sense. Heads 
or deputy-heads of 'families', monitors and foremen, had to live in 
close proximity to the inmates; their clothes were ‘almost as humble’ 
as those of the inmates themselves; they practically never left their 
side, observing them day and night; they constituted among them 
a network of permanent observation. And, in order to train them 
themselves, a specialized school had been organized in the colony. 
The essential element of its programme was to subject the future 
cadres to the same apprenticeships and to the same coercions as the 
inmates themselves: they were 'subjected as pupils to the discipline 
that, later, as instructors, they would themselves impose'. They were 
taught the art of power relations. It was the first training college in 
pure discipline: the 'penitentiary' was not simply a project that 
sought its justification in 'humanity' or its foundations in a 'science', 
but a technique that was learnt, transmitted and which obeyed 
general norms. The practice that normalized by compulsion the 
conduct of the undisciplined or dangerous could, in turn, by 
technical elaboration and rational reflection, be 'normalized'. The 
disciplinary technique became a ‘discipline’ which also had its 
school. 

It so happens that historians of the human sciences date the birth 
of scientific psychology at this time: during these same years, it 
seems, Weber was manipulating his little compass for the measure¬ 
ment of sensations. What took place at Mettray (and in other 


295 



Prison 


European countries sooner or later) was obviously of a quite differ¬ 
ent order. It was the emergence or rather the institutional specifica¬ 
tion, the baptism as it were, of a new type of supervision - both 
knowledge and power - over individuals who resisted disciplinary 
normalization. And yet, in the formation and growth of psychology, 
the appearance of these professionals of discipline, normality and 
subjection surely marks the beginning of a new stage. It will be said 
that the quantitative assessment of sensorial responses could at least 
derive authority from the prestige of the emerging science of 
physiology and that for this alone it deserves to feature in the 
history of the sciences. But the supervision of normality was firmly 
encased in a medicine or a psychiatry that provided it with a sort 
of ‘scientificity’; it was supported by a judicial apparatus which, 
directly or indirectly, gave it legal justification. Thus, in the shelter 
of these two considerable protectors, and, indeed, acting as a link 
between them, or a place of exchange, a carefully worked out 
technique for the supervision of norms has continued to develop 
right up to the present day. The specific, institutional supports of 
these methods have proliferated since the founding of the small 
school at Mettray; their apparatuses have increased in quantity and 
scope; their auxiliary services have increased, with hospitals, schools, 
public administrations and private enterprises; their agents have 
proliferated in number, in power, in technical qualification; the 
technicians of indiscipline have founded a family. In the normaliea- 
tion of the power of normalization, in the arrangement of a power- 
knowledge over individuals, Mettray and its school marked a new 
era. 

But why choose this moment as the point of emergence of the 
formation of an art of punishing that is still more or less our own? 
Precisely because this choice is somewhat ‘unjust’. Because it 
situates the ‘end’ of the process in the lower reaches of criminal law. 
Because Mettray was a prison, but not entirely; a prison in that it 
contained young delinquents condemned by the courts; and yet 
something else, too, because it also contained minors who had been 
charged, but acquitted under article 66 of the code, and boarders 
held, as in the eighteenth century, as an alternative to paternal 
correction. Mettray, a punitive model, is at the limit of strict 


The carceral 


penality. It was the most famous of a whole series of institutions 
which, well beyond the frontiers of criminal law, constituted what 
one might call the carceral archipelago. 

Yet the general principles, the great codes and subsequent legisla¬ 
tion were quite clear on the matter: no imprisonment ‘outside the 
law’, no detention that had not been decided by a qualified judicial 
institution, no more of those arbitrary and yet widespread confine¬ 
ments. Yet the very principle of extra-penal incarceration was in 
fact never abandoned. (A whole study remains to be done of the 
debates that took place during the Revolution concerning family 
courts, paternal correction and the right of parents to lock up their 
children.) And, if the apparatus of the great classical form of con¬ 
finement was partly (and only partly) dismantled, it was very soon 
reactivated, rearranged, developed in certain directions. But what is 
still more important is that it was homogenized, through the media¬ 
tion of the prison, on the one hand with legal punishments and, on 
the other, with disciplinary mechanisms. The frontiers between 
confinement, judicial punishment and institutions of discipline, 
which were already blurred in the classical age, tended to disappear 
and to constitute a great carceral continuum that diffused peniten¬ 
tiary techniques into the most innocent disciplines, transmitting 
disciplinary norms into the very heart of the penal system and 
placing over the slightest illegality, the smallest irregularity, devia¬ 
tion or anomaly, the threat of delinquency. A subtle, graduated 
carceral net, with compact institutions, but also separate and diffused 
methods, assumed responsibility for the arbitrary, widespread, 
badly integrated confinement of the classical age. 

I shall not attempt here to reconstitute the whole network that 
formed first the immediate surroundings of the prison, then spread 
farther and farther outwards. However, a few references and dates 
should give some idea of the breadth and precocity of the phenome¬ 
non. 

There were agricultural sections in the maisons centrales (the first 
example of which was Gaillon in 1824, followed later by Fontevrault, 
Les Douaires, Le Boulard); there were colonies for poor, abandoned 
vagrant children (Petit-Bourg in 1840, Ostwald in 1842); there were 
almshouses for young female offenders who 'recoiled before the idea 
of entering a life of disorder’, for ‘poor innocent girls whose 



Prison 


mothers' immorality has exposed to precocious perversity’, or for 
poor girls found on the doorsteps of hospitals and lodging houses. 
There were penal colonies envisaged by the law of 1850: minors, 
acquitted or condemned, were to be sent to these colonies and 
‘brought up in common, under strict discipline, and trained in 
agricultural work and in the principal industries related to it;’ later, 
they were to be joined by minors sentenced to hard labour for life 
and ‘vicious and insubordinate wards of the Public Assistance’ (on 
all these institutions, cf. Gaillac, 99-107). And, moving still farther 
away from penality in the strict sense, the carceral circles widen and 
the form of the prison slowly diminishes and finally disappears 
altogether: the institutions for abandoned or indigent children, the 
orphanages (like Neuhof or Mesnil-Firmin), the establishments for 
apprentices (like the Bethleem de Reims or the Maison de Nancy); 
still farther away the factory-convents, such as La Sauvagere, 
Tarare and Jujurieu (where the girl workers entered about the age of 
thirteen, lived confined for years and were allowed out only under 
surveillance, received instead of wages pledged payment, which 
could be increased by bonuses for zeal and good behaviour, which 
they could use only on leaving). And then, still farther, there w as a 
whole series of mechanisms that did not adopt the ‘compact’ prison 
model, but used some of the carceral methods: charitable societies, 
moral improvement associations, organizations that handed out 
assistance and also practised surveillance, workers' estates and 
lodging houses - the most primitive of which still bear the all too 
visible marks of the penitentiary system.* And, lastly, this great 
carceral network reaches all the disciplinary mechanisms that func¬ 
tion throughout society. 

We have seen that, in penal justice, the prison transformed the 
punitive procedure into a penitentiary technique; the carceral archi¬ 
pelago transported this technique from the penal institution to the 
entire social body. With several important results. 

1. This vast mechanism established a slow, continuous, imper¬ 
ceptible gradation that made it possible to pass naturally from dis¬ 
order to offence and back from a transgression of the law to a slight 
departure from a rule, an average, a demand, a norm. In the classical 
period, despite a certain common reference to offence in general,* 
the order of the crime, the order of sin and the order of bad conduct 


The carceral 


remained separate in so far as they related to separate criteria and 
authorities (court, penitence, confinement). Incarceration with its 
mechanisms of surveillance and punishment functioned, on the 
contrary, according to a principle of relative continuity. The con¬ 
tinuity of the institutions themselves, which were linked to one 
another (public assistance with the orphanage, the reformitory, the 
penitentiary, the disciplinary battalion, the prison; the school with 
the charitable society, the workshop, the almshouse, the peniten¬ 
tiary convent; the workers’ estate with the hospital and the prison). 
A continuity of the punitive criteria and mechanisms, which on the 
basis of a mere deviation gradually strengthened the rules and 
increased the punishment. A continuous gradation of the established, 
specialized and competent authorities (in the order of knowledge 
and in the order of power) which, without resort to arbitrariness, 
but strictly according to the regulations, by means of observation 
and assessment hierarchized, differentiated, judged, punished and 
moved gradually from the correction of irregularities to the punish¬ 
ment of crime. The ’carceral’ with its many diffuse or compact 
forms, its institutions of supervision or constraint, of discreet sur¬ 
veillance and insistent coercion, assured the communication of 
punishments according to quality and quantity; it connected in 
series or disposed according to subtle divisions the minor and the 
serious penalties, the mild and the strict forms of treatment, bad 
marks and light sentences. You will end up in the convict-ship, the 
slightest indiscipline seems to say; and the harshest of prisons says 
to the prisoners condemned to life: I shall note the slightest irregu¬ 
larity in your conduct. The generality of the punitive function that 
the eighteenth century sought in the ‘ideological’ technique of 
representations and signs now had as its support the extension, the 
material framework, complex, dispersed, but coherent, of the various 
carceral mechanisms. As a result, a certain significant generality 
moved between the least irregularity and the greatest crime; it was no 
longer the offence, the attack on the common interest, it was the 
departure from the norm, the anomaly; it was this that haunted 
the school, the court, the asylum or the prison. It generalized in 
the sphere of meaning the function that the carceral generalized in the 
sphere of tactics. Replacing the adversary of the sovereign, the 
social enemy was transformed into a deviant, who brought with him 


299 









Prison 


the multiple danger of disorder, crime and madness. The career «l 
network linked, through innumerable relations, the two long, 
multiple series of the punitive and the abnormal. 

2. The carceral, with its far-reaching networks, allows the re¬ 
cruitment of major 'delinquents*. It organizes what might be called 
'disciplinary careers’ in which, through various exclusions ami 
rejections, a whole process is set in motion. In the classical period J 
there opened up in the confines or interstices of society the contusrdJ 
tolerant and dangerous domain of the ‘outlaw* or at least of that 
which eluded the direct hold of power: an uncertain space that wa« 
for criminality a training ground and a region of refuge; ihcrJ 
poverty, unemployment, pursued innocence, cunning, the struggle 
against the powerful, the refusal of obligations and laws, and organ 
ized crime all came together as chance and fortune would dictatr, 
it was the domain of adventure that Gil Bias, Sheppard or Mandrin, 
each in his own way, inhabited. Through the play of disciplinary 
differentiations and divisions, the nineteenth century constructed 
rigorous channels which, within the system, inculcated docility and 
produced delinquency by the same mechanisms. There was a sort o| 
disciplinary 'training', continuous and compelling, that had some¬ 
thing of the pedagogical curriculum and something of the profes¬ 
sional network. Careers emerged from it, as secure, as predictable, 
as those of public life: assistance associations, residential apprentice¬ 
ships, penal colonics, disciplinary battalions, prisons, hospitals, 
almshouses. These networks were already well mapped out at the 
beginning of the nineteenth century: 'Our benevolent establish¬ 
ments present an admirably coordinated whole by means of which 
the indigent docs not remain a moment without help from the cradle 
to the grave. Follow the course of the unfortunate man: you will 
sec him born among foundlings; from there he passes to the nursery, 
then to an orphanage; at the age of six he goes off to primary school 
and later to adult schools. If he cannot work, he is placed on the list 
of the charity offices of his district, and if he falls ill he may choose 
between twelve hospitals. . . Lastly, when the poor Parisian 
reaches the end of his career, seven almshouses await his age and 
often their salubrious regime has prolonged his useless days well 
beyond those of the rich man’ (Moreau dc Jonnes, quoted in 
Touquet).

The carceral 


The carceral network does not cast the unassimilable into a con¬ 
fused hell; there is no outside. It takes back with one hand what it 
cems to exclude with the other. It saves everything, including what 
it punishes. It is unwilling to waste even what it has decided to 
disqualify. In this panoptic society of which incarceration is the 
omnipresent armature, the delinquent is not outside the law; he is, 
from the very outset, in the law, at the very heart of the law, or at 
least in the midst of those mechanisms that transfer the individual 
imperceptibly from discipline to the law, from deviation to offence. 
Although it is true that prison punishes delinquency, delinquency 
is for the most part produced in and by an incarceration which, 
ultimately, prison perpetuates in its turn. The prison is merely the 
natural consequence, no more than a higher degree, of that hier¬ 
archy laid down step by step. The delinquent is an institutional 
product. It is no use being surprised, therefore, that in a consider¬ 
able proportion of cases the biography of convicts passes through 
all these mechanisms and establishments, whose purpose, it is widely 
believed, is to lead away from prison. That one should find in them 
what one might call the index of an irrepressibly delinquent 'char¬ 
acter': the prisoner condemned to hard labour was meticulously pro¬ 
duced by a childhood spent in a reformatory, according to the lines 
of force of the generalized carceral system. Conversely, the lyricism 
of marginality may find inspiration in the image of the 'outlaw', the 
great social nomad, who prowls on the confines of a docile, fright¬ 
ened order. But it is not on the fringes of society and through succes¬ 
sive exiles that criminality is born, but by means of ever more 
closely placed insertions, under ever more insistent surveillance, by 
an accumulation of disciplinary coercion. In short, the carceral 
archipelago assures, in the depths of the social body, the formation 
of delinquency on the basis of subtle illegalities, the overlapping of the 
latter by the former and the establishment of a specified criminality. 

3. But perhaps the most important effect of the carceral system 
and of its extension well beyond legal imprisonment is that it suc¬ 
ceeds in making the power to punish natural and legitimate, in 
lowering at least the threshold of tolerance to penality. It tends to 
efface what may be exorbitant in the exercise of punishment. It does 
this by playing the two registers in which it is deployed - the legal 
register of justice and the extra-legal register of discipline - against 


301 



Prison 


The carceral 


one another. In effect, the great continuity of the carceral system 
throughout the law and its sentences gives a sort of legal sanction 
to the disciplinary mechanisms, to the decisions and judgements 
that they enforce. Throughout this network, which comprises so 
many ‘regional’ institutions, relatively autonomous and independent, 
is transmitted, with the 'prison-form', the model of justice itself. 
The regulations of the disciplinary establishments may reproduce 
the law, the punishments imitate the verdicts and penalties, the 
surveillance repeat the police model; 3 nd, above all these multiple 
establishments, the prison, which in relation to them is a pure form, 
unadulterated and unmitigated, gives them a sort of official sanction. 
The carceral, with its long gradation stretching from the convict- 
ship or imprisonment with hard labour to diffuse, slight limitations, 
communicates a type of power that the law validates and that justice 
uses as its favourite weapon. How could the disciplines and the 
power that functions in them appear arbitrary, when they merely 
operate the mechanisms of justice itself, even with a view to mitigat¬ 
ing their intensity? When, by generalizing its effects and trans¬ 
mitting it to every level, it makes it possible to avoid its full r.gour? 
Carceral continuity and the fusion of the prison-form make it 
possible to legalize, or in any case to legitimate disciplinary power, 
which thus avoids any element of excess or abuse it may entail. 

But, conversely, the carceral pyramid gives to the power to 
inflict legal punishment a context in which it appears to be free of all 
excess and all violence. In the subtle gradation of the apparatuses of 
discipline and of the successive 'embeddings’ that they involve, the 
prison docs not at all represent the unleashing of a different kind of 
power, but simply an additional degree in the intensity of a mechan¬ 
ism that has continued to operate since the earliest forms of legal 
punishment. Between the latest institution of'rehabilitation', where 
one is taken in order to avoid prison, and the prison where one is 
sent after a definable offence, the difference is (and must be) scarcely 
perceptible. There is a strict economy that has the effect of render¬ 
ing as discreet as possible the singular power to punish. There is 
nothing in it now that recalls the former excess of sovereign pow er 
when it revenged its authority on the tortured body of those about 
to be executed. Prison continues, on those who are entrusted to it, 
a work begun elsew-here, which the whole of society pursues on 



each individual through innumerable mechanisms of discipline. By 
means of a carceral continuum, the authority that sentences infil¬ 
trates all those other authorities that supervise, transform, correct, 
improve. It might even be said that nothing really distinguishes 
them any more except the singularly ‘dangerous’ character of the 
delinquents, the gravity of their departures from normal behaviour 
and the necessary solemnity of the ritual. But, in its function, the 
powder to punish is not essentially different from that of curing or 
educating. It receives from them, and from their lesser, smaller task, 
a sanction from below; but one that is no less important for that, 
since it is the sanction of technique and rationality. The carceral 
'naturalizes' the legal pow f er to punish, as it 'legalizes' the technical 
power to discipline. In thus homogenizing them, effacing what may 
be violent in one and arbitrary in the other, attenuating the effects of 
revolt that they may both arouse, thus depriving excess in either of 
any purpose, circulating the same calculated, mechanical and dis¬ 
creet methods from one to the other, the carceral makes it possible 
to carry out that great ‘economy’ of power whose formula the 
eighteenth century had sought, when the problem of the accumula¬ 
tion and useful administration of men first emerged. 

By operating at every level of the social body and by mingling 
ceaselessly the art of rectifying and the right to punish, the universal¬ 
ity of the carceral lowers the level from which it becomes natural 
and acceptable to be punished. The question is often posed as to 
how, before and after the Revolution, a new foundation was given 
to the right to punish. And no doubt the answer is to be found in 
the theory of the contract. But it is perhaps more important to ask 
the reverse question: how were people made to accept the power to 
punish, or quite simply, when punished, tolerate being so. The 
theory of the contract can only answer this question by the fiction 
of a juridical subject giving to others the power to exercise over him 
the right that he himself possesses over them. It is highly probable 
that the great carceral continuum, which provides a communication 
between the pow-er of discipline and the power of the law, and 
extends without interruption from the smallest coercions to the 
longest penal detention, constituted the technical and real, immedi¬ 
ately material counterpart of that chimerical granting of the right to 
punish. 




Prison 


4. With this new economy of power, the carceral system, which 
is its basic instrument, permitted the emergence of a new form of 
‘law’: a mixture of legality and nature, prescription and constitution, 
the norm. This had a whole series of effects: the internal dislocation 
of the judicial power or at least of its functioning; an increasing 
difficulty in judging, as if one were ashamed to pass sentence; a 
furious desire on the part of the judges to judge, assess, diagnose, 
recognize the normal and abnormal and claim the honour of curing 
or rehabilitating. In view of this, it is useless to believe in the good 
or bad consciences of judges, or even of their unconscious. Their 
immense 'appetite for medicine' which is constantly manifested - 
from their appeal to psychiatric experts, to their attention to the 
chatter of criminology - expresses the major fact that the power 
they exercise has been 'denatured'; that it is at a certain level governed 
by laws; that at another, more fundamental level it functions as a 
normative power; it is the economy of power that they exercise, 
and not that of their scruples or their humanism, that makes them 
pass 'therapeutic' sentences and recommend 'rehabilitating' periods 
of imprisonment. But, conversely, if the judges accept ever more 
reluctantly to condemn for the sake of condemning, the activity of 
judging has increased precisely to the extent that the normalizing 
power has spread. Borne along by the omnipresence of the mcchin- 
isms of discipline, basing itself on all the carceral apparatuses, it has 
become one of the major functions of our society. The judges of 
normality are present everywhere. We are in the society of the 
teacher-judge, the doctor-judge, the educator-judge, the ‘social 
worker'-judge; it is on them that the universal reign of the normative 
is based; and each individual, wherever he may find himself, subjects 
to it his body, his gestures, his behaviour, his aptitudes, his achieve¬ 
ments. The carceral network, in its compact or disseminated forms, 
with its systems of insertion, distribution, surveillance, observation, 
has been the greatest support, in modern society, of the normalizing 
power. 

5. The carceral texture of society assures both the real capture 
of the body and its perpetual observation; it is, by its very nature, 
the apparatus of punishment that conforms most completely to the 
new economy of power and the instrument for the formation of 
knowledge that this very economy needs. Its panoptic functioning 


304 


The carceral 


enables it to play this double role. By virtue of its methods of fixing, 
dividing, recording, it has been one of the simplest, crudest, also 
most concrete, but perhaps most indispensable conditions for the 
development of this immense activity of examination that has objec¬ 
tified human behaviour. If, after the age of‘inquisitorial’ justice, we 
have entered the age of 'examinatory' justice, if, in an even more 
general way, the method of examination has been able to spread so 
widely throughout society, and to give rise in part to the sciences 
of man, one of the great instruments for this has been the multiplicity 
and close overlapping of the various mechanisms of incarceration. 

I am not saying that the human sciences emerged from the prison. 
But, if they have been able to be formed and to produce so many 
profound changes in the episteme, it is because they have been 
conveyed by a specific and new modality of power: a certain policy 
of the body, a certain way of rendering the group of men docile and 
useful. This policy required the involvement of definite relations of 
knowledge in relations of power; it called for a technique of over¬ 
lapping subjection and objectification; it brought with it new pro¬ 
cedures of individualization. The carceral network constituted one 
of the armatures of this power-knowledge that has made the human 
sciences historically possible. Knowablc man (soul, individuality, 
consciousness, conduct, whatever it is called) is the object-effect 
of this analytical investment, of this domination-observation. 

6. This no doubt explains the extreme solidity of the prison, that 
slight invention that was nevertheless decried from the outset. If it 
had been no more than an instrument of rejection or repression in 
the service of a state apparatus, it would have been easier to alter its 
more overt forms or to find a more acceptable substitute for it. But, 
rooted as it was in mechanisms and strategies of power, it could 
meet any attempt to transform it with a great force of inertia. One 
fact is characteristic: when it is a question of altering the system of 
imprisonment, opposition does not come from the judicial institu¬ 
tions alone; resistance is to be found not in the prison as penal sanc¬ 
tion, but in the prison with all its determinations, links and extra¬ 
judicial results; in the prison as the relay in a general network of 
disciplines and surveillances; in the prison as it functions in a panop¬ 
tic regime. This docs not mean that it cannot be altered, nor that it 
is once and for all indispensable to our kind of society. One may, on

The carceral 


the contrary, site the two processes which, in the very- continuity of 
the processes that make the prison function, are capable of exercising 
considerable restraint on its use and of transforming its internal 
functioning. And no doubt these processes have already begun to a 
large degree. The first is that which reduces the utility (or increases 
its inconveniences) of a delinquency accommodated as a specific 
illegality, locked up and supervised; thus the growth of great 
national or international illegalities directly linked to the political 
and economic apparatuses (financial illegalities, information services, 
arms and drugs trafficking, property speculation) makes it clear that 
the somewhat rustic and conspicuous work force of delinquency is 
proving ineffective; or again, on a smaller scale, as soon as the 
economic levy on sexual pleasure is carried out more efficiently by 
the sale of contraceptives, or obliquely through publications, films 
or shows, the archaic hierarchy of prostitution loses much of its 
former usefulness. The second process is the growth of the disci¬ 
plinary networks, the multiplication of their exchanges with the 
penal apparatus, the ever more important powers that are given 
them, the ever more massive transference to them of judicial func¬ 
tions; now, as medicine, psychology, education, public assistance, 
‘social work’ assume an ever greater share of the powers of super¬ 
vision and assessment, the penal apparatus will be able, in turn, to 
become mcdicalized, psychologized, cducationalized; and by the 
same token that turning-point represented by the prison becomes 
less useful when, through the gap between its penitentiary discourse 
and its effect of consolidating delinquency, it articulates the penal 
power and the disciplinary power. In the midst of all these mechan¬ 
isms of normalization, which are becoming ever more rigorous in 
their application, the specificity of the prison and its role as link are 
losing something of their purpose. 

If there is an overall political issue around the prison, it is not 
therefore whether it is to be corrective or not; whether the judges, 
the psychiatrists or the sociologists are to exercise more power in it 
than the administrators or supervisors; it is not even whether we 
should have prison or something other than prison. At present, the 
problem lies rather in the steep rise in the use of these mechanisms 
of normalization and the wide-ranging powers which, through the 
proliferation of new disciplines, they bring with them. 


In 1836, a correspondent wrote to La Phalange: ‘Moralists, 
philosophers, legislators, flatterers of civilization, this is the plan of 
your Paris, neatly ordered and arranged, here is the improved plan 
in which all like things are gathered together. At the centre, and 
within a first enclosure: hospitals for all diseases, almshouse* for 
all types ot poverty, madhouses, prisons, convict-prisons for men, 
women and children. Around the first enclosure, barracks, court¬ 
rooms, police stations, houses for prison warders, scaffolds, houses 
for the executioner and his assistants. At the four corners, the 
Chamber of Deputies, the Chamber of Peers, the Institute and the 
Royal Palace. Outside, there are the various services that supply 
the central enclosure, commerce, with its swindlers and its bank¬ 
ruptcies; industry and its furious struggles; the press, with its 
sophisms; the gambling dens; prostitution, the people dying of 
hunger or wallowing in debauchery, always ready to lend an ear 
to the voice of the Genius of Revolutions; the heartless rich. . . 
Lastly the ruthless war of all against all’ (La Phalange , 10 August 
18)6). 

I shall stop with this anonymous text. We are now far away from 
the country of tortures, dotted with wheels, gibbets, gallows, 
pillories; we arc far, too, from that dream of the reformers, less 
than fifty years before: the city of punishments in which a thousand 
small theatres would have provided an endless multicoloured repre¬ 
sentation of justice in which the punishments, meticulously pro¬ 
duced on decorative scaffolds, would have constituted the permanent 
festival of the penal code. The carceral city, with its imaginary 
'geo-politics’, is governed by quite different principles. The extract 
from La Phalange reminds us of some of the more important ones: 
that at the centre of this city, and as if to hold it in place, there is, 
not the ‘centre of power’, not a network of forces, but a multiple 
network of diverse elements - walls, space, institution, rules, dis¬ 
course; that the model of the carceral city is not, therefore, the body 
of the king, with the powers that emanate from it, nor the contrac¬ 
tual meeting of wills from which a body that was both individual 
and collective was born, but a strategic distribution of elements of 
different natures and levels. That the prison is not the daughter of 
laws, codes or the judicial apparatus; that it is not subordinated to 
the court and the docile or clumsy instrument of the sentences that 


Prison 


it hands out and of the results that it would like to achieve; that it ■* 
the court that is external and subordinate to the prison. That in thr 
central position that it occupies, it is not alone, but linked to a who If 
series of ‘carceral’ mechanisms which seem distinct enough - sine* 
they are intended to alleviate pain, to cure, to comfort - but which 
all tend, like the prison, to exercise a power of normalization. That 
these mechanisms are applied not to transgressions against a ‘central' 
law, but to the apparatus of production - ‘commerce’ and ‘industry* 
- to a whole multiplicity of illegalities, in all their diversity of mturr 
and origin, their specific role in profit and the different ways in 
which they are dealt with by the punitive mechanisms. And tlut 
ultimately what presides over all these mechanisms is not the unitary 
functioning of an apparatus or an institution, but the necessity of 
combat and the rules of strategy. That, consequently, the notions ol 
institutions of repression, rejection, exclusion, marginalization, are 
not adequate to describe, at the very centre of the carceral city, the 
formation of the insidious leniencies, unavowable petty cruelties, 
small acts of cunning, calculated methods, techniques, 'sciences' 
that permit the fabrication of the disciplinary individual. In this 
central and centralized humanity, the effect and instrument of com¬ 
plex power relations, bodies and forces subjected by multiple 
mechanisms of ‘incarceration’, objects for discourses that are in 
themselves elements for this strategy, we must hear the distant roar 
of battle. 

At this point I end a book that must serve as a historical back¬ 
ground to various studies of the power of normalization and the 
formation of knowledge in modern society.
