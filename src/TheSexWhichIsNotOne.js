const TheSexWhichIsNotOne = `Female sexuality has always been conceptualized on the basis of masculine parameters. Thus the opposition between "mas­culine" clitoral activity and "feminine" vaginal passivity, an opposition which Freud-and many others-saw as stages, or alternatives, in the development ofa  sexually "normal" wom­an, seems rather too required by the of male For the clitoris is conceived as a little penis pleasant to masturbate so long as castration anxiety does not (for the boy child), and the vagina is valued for the "lodging" it offers the male organ when the forbidden hand has to find a  replace­ment for pleasure-giving. In these terms, woman's erogenous zones never amount to anything but a  clitoris-sex that is not comparable to the noble phallic organ, or a  hole-envelope that serves to sheathe massage the penis in intercourse: a  non-sex, or a  masculine organ turned back upon itself, self-embracing. About woman and her pleasure, this view of the sexual rela­tion has nothing to Her lot is  that of "lack," "atrophy" (of the sexual organ), and "penis envy," the penis being the only sexual organ of recognized value. Thus she attempts by every means available to appropriate that organ for herself: through her somewhat servile love ofthe father-husband capable of giving her one, through her desire for a  child-penis, preferably a boy, through access to the cultural values still reserved by right to males alone and therefore always masculine, and so on. Woman lives her own desire only as the expectation that she may at last come to possess an equivalent of the male organ. Yet all this  appears quite foreign to her own pleasure, unless it remains within the dominant phallic economy. Thus, for example, woman's autoeroticism is very different from man's. In order to touch himself, man needs an instrument: his hand, a woman's body, language ... And this self-caressing requires at least a minimum of activity. As for woman, she touches herself in and of herself without any need for mediation, and before there is any way to distinguish activity from passivity. Woman "touches herself' all the time, and moreover no one can forbid her to do so, for her genitals are formed oftwo lips in continuous contact. Thus, within herself, she is already two­but not divisible into one(s)-that caress each other. This autoerotIcIsm is disrupted by a violent break-in: the brutal separation of the two lips by a  violating penis, an intru­sion that distracts and deflects the woman from this "self-ca­ressing" she needs ifshe is not to incur the disappearance ofher own pleasure in sexual relations. If the vagina is to serve also, but not only, to take over for the little boy's hand in order to assure an articulation between autoeroticism and hetero­eroticism in intercourse (the encounter with the totally other always signifying death), how, in the classic representation of sexuality, can the perpetuation of autoeroticism for woman be managed? Will woman not be left with the impossible alter­native between a  defensive virginity, fiercely turned in upon itself, and a body open to penetration that no longer knows, in this "hole" that constitutes its sex, the pleasure of its own touch? The more or less exclusive-and highly anxious-atten­tion paid to erection in Western sexuality proves to what extent the imaginary that governs it is  foreign to the feminine. For the most part, this sexuality offers nothing but imperatives dictated by male rivalry: the "strongest" being the one who has the best "hard-on," the longest, the biggest, the stiffest penis, or even the one who "pees the farthest" (as in little boys' contests). Or else one finds imperatives dictated by the enactment ofsadoma­sochistic fantasies, these in turn governed by man's relation to his mother: the desire to force entry, to penetrate, to appropri­ate for himself the mystery of this womb where he has been conceived, the secret of his begetting, of his "origin." De­sire/need, also to make blood flow again in order to revive a very old relationship-intrauterine, to be sure, but also pre­historic-to the maternal. Woman, in this sexual imaginary, is only a more or less obliging prop for the enactment of man's fantasies. That she may find pleasure there in that role, by proxy, is possible, even certain. But such pleasure is above all a masochistic prostitution ofher body to a desire that is not her own, and it leaves her in a familiar state ofdependency upon man. Not knowing what she wants, ready for anything, even asking for more, so long as he will "take" her as his "object" when he seeks his own pleasure. Thus she will not say what she herself wants; moreover, she does not know, or no longer knows, what she wants. As Freud admits, the beginnings of the sexual life of a  girl child are so "obscure," so "faded with time," that one would have to dig down very deep indeed to discover beneath the traces of this civilization, of this history, the vestiges of a more archaic civi­lization that might give some clue to woman's sexuality. That extremely ancient civilization would undoubtedly have a differ­ent alphabet, a  different language ... Woman's desire would not be expected to speak the same language as man's; woman's desire has doubtless been submerged by the logic that has domi­nated the West since the time of the Greeks. Within this logic, the predominance of the visual, and of the discrimination and individualization of form, is particularly for­ eign to female erotIcIsm. Woman takes pleasure more from touching than from looking, and her entry into a dominant scopic economy signifies, again, her consignment to passivity: she is to be the beautiful object of contemplation. While her body finds itself thus eroticized, and called to a  double move­ment ofexhibition and ofchaste retreat in order to stimulate the drives the "subject," her represents the horror of nothing to see. A defect in this ofrepresentation and desire. A "hole" in its scoptophilic lens. It is Greek statuary that this nothing-to-see has to be excluded, re­jected, from such a  scene of representation. Woman's genitals are simply absent, masked, sewn back up inside their"crack." This organ which has nothing to show for itself also lacks a its own. And if woman takes pleasure precisely from H..umpleteness of form which allows her organ to touch itself over and over again, indefinitely, by itself, that pleasure is denied by a  civilization that privileges phallomorphism. The value granted to the only definable form excludes the one that is in play in female autoeroticism. The one of form, of the indi­vidual, of the (male) sexual organ, of the proper name, of the proper meaning ... supplants, while separating and dividing, that contact of at least two (lips) which keeps woman in touch herself, but without any possibility ofdistinguishing what is touching from what is touched. the mystery that woman represents in a culture claiming to count everything, to number everything by units, to inventory everything as individualities. She is neither one nor two. Rigorously speaking, she cannot be identified either as one person, or as two. She resists all adequate definition. Further, she has no "proper" name. And her sexual organ, which is not one organ, is counted as none. The negative, the underside, the reverse of the only visible and morphologically designatable organ (even if the passage from erection to detumescence does pose some problems): the penis. But "thickness" of that "form," the layering of its vol­ume, its expansions and contractions and even the spacing of the moments in which it produces itself as form-all this the feminine keeps secret. Without knowing it. And if woman is asked to sustain, to revive, man's the request neglects to spell out what it implies as to the value of her own desire. A desire of which she is not aware, moreover, at least not ex­plicitly. But one whose force and continuity are capable of nurturing repeatedly and at length all the masquerades of"fem­that are expected of her. It is true that she still has the child, in relation to whom her appetite for touch, for contact, has rein, unless it is lost, alienated by the taboo against touching of a sessive civilization. Otherwise her pleasure will find, in the child, compensations for and diversions from the frustrations that she too often encounters in sexual relations per se. Thus maternity fills the gaps in a repressed female sexuality. Perhaps man and woman no longer caress each other except through mediation between them that the child-preferably a boy-represents? Man, identified with his son, rediscovers the pleasure ofmaternal fondling; woman touches herself again caressing that part ofher body: her baby-penis-ditoris. What this entails for the amorous trio is well known. But the Oedipal interdiction seems to be a somewhat categorical and factitious law-although it does provide the means for per­petuating the authoritarian discourse of fathers-when it is promulgated in a  culture in which sexual relations are imprac­ticable because man's desire and woman's are strangers to each And in which the two desires have to try to meet through indirect means, whether the archaic one ofa sense-relation to the mother's body, or the present one ofactive or passive extension of the law of the father. These are regressive emotional behav­iors, exchanges ofwords too detached from the sexual arena not to constitute an exile with respect to it: "mother" and "father" couple, but as social roles. The nrpupnt-<, them from making love. They pro­quite knowing how to use their as tlley have, such little indeed as they wish to what are they to do with leisure? What substitute for amorous resource are they to invent? Still ... Perhaps it is time to return to that repressed entity, the female imaginary. So woman does not have a  sex organ? She has at least two of them, but they are not identifiable as ones. Indeed, she has many more. Her sexuality, 
always at least double, even further: it is plural. Is this the way culture is seeking to characterize itself now? Is this the way texts write them­selves/ are written now? Without quite knowing what cen­sorship they are evading? Indeed, woman's pleasure does not have to choose between clitoral activity and for example. pleasure ofthe vaginal caress does not be substituted for that of the clitoral caress. They each ute, irreplaceably, to woman's pleasure. Among resses ... Fondling the breasts, touching the vulva, spreading stroking posterior wall of the vagina, brushing ofthe uterus, and so on. To evoke only a few most female pleasures. Pleasures which are somewhat misunderstood in sexual difference as it is imag­ined-or not imagined, the other sex being only the indispens­able complement to the only sex. But woman has sex organs more or less everywhere. She finds pleasure almost anywhere. Even if we refrain from invoking the hystericization of her entire body, the geography of her pleasure is far more diversified, more multiple in its differences, more complex, more subtle, than is commonly imagined-in an imaginary rather too narrowly focused on sameness. "She" is indefinitely other in herself This is doubtless why is said to be whimsical, incomprehensible, agitated, capriciousnot to mention her language, in which "she" sets off in all directions leaving "him" unable to discern the coherence ofany meaning. Hers are contradictory words, somewhat mad from the standpoint of reason, inaudible for whoever listens to them with ready-made grids, with a  fully elaborated code in hand. For in what she says, too, at least when she dares, woman is constantly touching herself. She steps ever so slightly aside from herself with a murmur, an exclamation, a whisper, a sen­tence left unfinished .  .  . When she returns, it is to set offagain from elsewhere. From another point pleasure, or of pain. One would have to listen with another ear. as if hearing an ojembracing ~ in order not to become congealed in them. For if "she" says something, it is  not, it is already no longer, identical with what she means. What she says is never identical with anything, moreover; rather, it is contiguous. It touches (upon). And when it  strays too far from that proximity, she breaks off and starts over at "zero": her body-sex. It is useless, then, to trap women in the exact definition of what they  mean, to make them repeat (themselves) so that it will be clear; they are already elsewhere in that discursive ma­chinery where you expected to surprise them. They have re­turned within themselves. Which must not be understood in the same way as within yourself. They do not have the interiority that you have, the one you perhaps suppose they have. Within themselves means within the intimacy oJthat touch. And if you ask them insistently about, they can only reply: Thus what they desire is same time everything. more and something else organ, for you give to them. Their desire is interpreted, and as a sort ofinsatiable hunger, a voracity that will swal­you whole. Whereas it really involves a different economy  more than anything else, one that upsets the linearity of a pro­ject, undermines the goal-object of a desire, diffuses the polar­ization toward a  single pleasure, disconcerts fidelity to a single discourse ... Must this multiplicity of female desire and female language be understood as shards, scattered remnants of a violated sexu­ality? A sexuality denied? question has no simple answer. The rejection, the exclusion of a  female imaginary certainly puts woman in the position of experiencing herself only frag­mentarily, in the little-structured margins of a dominant Qlogy, as waste, or excess, what is left of a mirror invested by the (masculine) "subject" to reflect himself, to copy himself Moreover, the role of "femininity" is prescribed by this mas­culine specula{riza)tion and corresponds scarcely at all to wom­an's desire, which may be recovered only in secret, in hiding, with anxiety and guilt. But if the female imaginary were to deploy itself, if it bring itself into play otherwise than as scraps, uncollected de­bri.s, would it  represent itself, even so, in the form of one uni­verse? Would it even be volume instead of surface? No. Not unless it were understood, yet as a  privileging of the maternal over the feminine. Of a  phallic maternal, at that. Closed in upon the jealous possession of its valued product. Rivaling man in his esteem for productive excess. In such a race for power, woman loses the uniqueness of her pleasure. By dosing herself off as volume, she renounces the pleasure that she gets from the nonsuture of her lips: she is undoubtedly a mother, but a mother; the was assigned to her by mythologies long ago. Granting her a  certain social power to the extent that she is reduced, with her own complicity, to sexual impotence. (Re-)discovering herself, for a woman, thus could only signi­fy the possibility of sacrificing no one of her pleasures to another, of identifying herself with none of them in particular, of never being simply one. A sort ofexpanding universe to which no limits could be fixed and which would not be incoherence nonetheless-nor that polymorphous perversion ofthe child in which the erogenous zones would lie waiting to be regrouped under the primacy of the phallus. Woman always remains several, but she is kept from disper­sion because the other is  already within her and is  autoerotically familiar to her. Which 'is not to that she appropriates the other for herself, that she reduces it to her own property. Ownership and property are doubtless quite foreign to the fem­inine. At least sexually. But not nearness. Nearness so pro­nounced that it makes all discrimination ofidentity, and thus all forms of property, impossible. Woman derives pleasure from is so near that she cannot have it, nor have herse~f She herself enters into a ceaseless exchange ofherself with the other with­out any possibility ofidentifying either. This puts into question all prevailing economies: their calculations are irremediably stymied by woman's pleasure, as it increases indefinitely from its passage in and through the other. However, in order for woman to the place where she takes pleasure as woman, a long detour by way of the analysis of the various systems of oppression brought to bear upon her is assuredly necessary. And claiming to fall back on the single solution ofpleasure risks making her miss the process of going back through a  social practice that her enjoyment requires. For woman is traditionally a use-value for man, an exch:m~~e value among men; in other words, a commodity. As such, remains the guardian ofmaterial substance, whose price will be established, in terms of the standard of their and of their need! desire, by "subjects": workers, merchants, consumers. Women are marked phallicly by their fathers, husbands, pro­curers. And this branding determines their value in sexual com­merce. Woman is never anything but the locus ofa more or less ompetitive exchange between two men, including the com­petition for the possession of mother earth. How can this object of transaction claim a right to pleasure without removing her/itself from established commerce? With respect to other merchandise in the marketplace, how could this commodity maintain a relationship other than one ofaggressive jealousy? How could material substance enjoy her/itself with­out provoking the consumer's anxiety over the disappearance ofhis nurturing ground? How could that exchange-which can no way be defined in terms "proper" to woman's desire­appear as anything but a pure mirage, mere foolishness, all too readily obscured by a more sensible discourse and by a  system of apparently more tangible values? A woman's development, however radical it may seek to be, would thus not suffice to liberate woman's desire. And to date no political theory or political practice has resolved, or suffl.­ciently taken into consideration, this historical problem, even though Marxism has proclaimed its importance. But women do not constitute, strictly speaking, a class, and their dispersion among several classes makes their political struggle complex, their demands sometimes contradictory. There remains, however, the condition ofunderdevelopment arising from women's submission by and to a  culture that op­presses them, uses them, makes ofthem a medium ofexchange, with very little profit to them. Except in the quasi monopolies of masochistic pleasure, the domestic labor force, and re­production. The powers of slaves? Which are not negligible powers, moreover. For where pleasure is  concerned, the master is not necessarily well served. Thus to reverse the relation, especially in the economy of sexuality, does not seem a  desir­able objective. But ifwomen are to preserve and expand their autoeroticism, their homo-sexuality, might not the renunciation ofheterosex­ual pleasure correspond once again to that disconnection from  power that is traditionally theirs? Would it not involve a new prison, a new cloister, built oftheir own accord? For women to undertake tactical  strikes, to keep themselves apart from men long enough to learn to defend their desire, especially through speech, to discover the love of other women while sheltered from men's imperious choices that put them in the position of rival commodities, to forge for themselves a  social status that compels recognition, to earn their living in order to escape from the condition ofprostitute .  .  . these are certainly indispensable stages in the escape from their proletarization on the exchange market. But if their aim were simply to reverse the order of things, even supposing this to be possible, history would repeat itself in the long run, would revert to sameness: to phallocra­tism. It would leave room neither for women's sexuality, nor for women's imaginary, nor for women's language to take (their) place. `
